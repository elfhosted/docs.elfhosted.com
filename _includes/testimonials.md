## What users say..

Here's what some of our {--users--}{++friends++} say..

> I’ve been using this service for a while now, and honestly, it’s a game-changer compared to anything else I’ve tried for managing my media library. The support is fantastic—super quick, and if the staff aren’t around (which rarely happens), the community steps up right away. I can’t imagine going back to any other platform.
> 
> Before this, I had my own setup with a NUC, NAS, and tools like Sonarr and Radarr. It worked pretty well for a while, and my internet speed was high enough to stream without any buffering. But in the end, it wasn’t worth the time or headache of managing all the storage and keeping everything running smoothly.
> 
> Now, with this service, everything runs smoothly in 1080p+ with no buffering issues. The interface is really easy to use, which makes managing everything a breeze. Plus, having a whole community of smart people available for guidance is a huge bonus.
> 
> I was sold from the start, which is why I quickly upgraded from a 1-month to a 3-month subscription, and I’m planning to switch to a 1-year plan soon. This service totally pays for itself, and I’m sure you won’t be disappointed. It’s been really impressive.

> "The Elfhosted product alone is great. The team is super transparent on the issues and resolutions that happen as it grows. Lots of opportunity to self-solve issues, but the support from both mods and darth-penguini is SO quick and proactive. Props to them."

> "I don't understand how there aren't tons of elves already. The way this whole thing is setup is great, from getting a free $10 amount of elfbuckz to start, free 7 day trials on most services, the subscription prices of the products are reasonable, to the smoothness of how everything runs. I just dont get it, people choose to pay way more with places that don't provide the same customer service nor have a great community like this one. I recommend elfhosted to everyone.

!!! note "Pricing update since this review"
    Our [pricing model](/open/pricing/) was updated in July 2024, removing the free $10 ElfBuckz and the 7-day trials, and replacing them with standard pricing tiers and a 14-day refund policy.

> "Just wanted to check in here and let \@Darth-Penguini and anyone/everyone else know...WOW. I have been struggling with storage for years, maintenance of Docker containers, upkeep, all of it. Elfhosted is so freeing. It's an amazing service that I hope to be a member of for a long, long time!"

> "I just have to say, I am an incredibly satisfied customer. I had been collecting my own content for nearly 20 years. Starting off with just a simple external HD before eventually graduating to a seedbox with 100TB of cloud storage attached and fully automated processes with Sonarr and Radarr . However, the time came when the glory days of unlimited Google Drive storage ended. I thought my days of having my full collection at my fingertips via :plex: were behind me, until I found Real-Debrid and ElfHosted. 
> 
> Now I essentially have the exact same access to content as I had before, but even better. Superior support and community involvement. Content is available almost immediately after being identified. A plethora of tools at my fingertips that give me more control and automation than ever before. Wonderfully well done and impressive! I am looking forward to being a customer for a very long time! Massive kudos to @funkypenguin 🤟

> "I would recommend ElfHosted to anyone. It has been great so far and made life a lot easier than running my own setups. If you’re in the fence give them a try and help support this great community."
