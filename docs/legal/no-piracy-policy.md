# No-Piracy Policy

**Effective Date:** 19 Dec 2025

This policy applies to all ElfHosted services and community spaces (Discord, Reddit, social channels, support tickets, etc.). It takes cues from the Jellyfin forums' [Piracy Policy](https://forum.jellyfin.org/t-jellyfin-forum-rules/) and exists to keep the community focused on legal self-hosting.

## What ElfHosted does (and doesn’t) provide

- ElfHosted supplies hosting automation and application infrastructure only. We do **not** provide, curate, seed, mirror, or otherwise distribute media content.
- Any storage you connect, files you ingest, or libraries you build are entirely under your control and at your own risk. You alone are responsible for ensuring your content complies with every applicable copyright and licensing law.

## Conduct rules

1. **No sourcing talk.** Do not describe, brag about, or otherwise identify where you obtained media. Phrases such as “I grabbed this from SomeTorrentSite” are disallowed. If the source is relevant for troubleshooting, use neutral terminology (e.g., “WEB rip”) without naming services or scene groups.
2. **No piracy links or instructions.** Sharing URLs, magnet links, screenshots, or “how-to” guidance for piracy sites, trackers, forums, Discords, or automation scripts is strictly prohibited.
3. **No redistribution.** Selling, trading, leasing, or giving public access to your ElfHosted apps or libraries—especially when you do not hold the rights to distribute the media—counts as piracy and violates our [No Reselling Policy](/legal/no-reselling-policy/). Community support will be refused and services may be terminated.
4. **Scrub identifiable evidence.** Logs, screenshots, or filenames that clearly reference pirated sources (scene tags, tracker URLs, OTT brand watermarks, etc.) must be removed before posting. If you cannot share redacted evidence, do not share it at all.
5. **Respect takedowns.** If ElfHosted or an upstream provider receives a credible infringement notice about your account, you must remediate immediately. Failure to comply can result in suspension or deletion of services without refund.

## Enforcement

Violations of this policy also breach the [Terms of Service](/legal/terms-of-service/), [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use/), and [No Reselling Policy](/legal/no-reselling-policy/). Depending on severity, we may:

- Warn and remove offending posts or tickets.
- Temporarily or permanently suspend your community access or hosted services.
- Report egregious behavior or repeat offenders to upstream providers, payment processors, or relevant authorities.

ElfHosted reserves the right to refuse support or terminate accounts that engage in piracy or help others pirate. Keep discussions focused on legal, self-hosted workflows and we’ll all have a safer community.
