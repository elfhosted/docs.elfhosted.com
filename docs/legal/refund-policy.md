# Refund Policy

## Trial Periods vs refunds

ElfHosted provide generous 7-day trial packages of our apps, starter, and Hobbit bundles. The intention of these trial periods is to afford users ample time to discover the platform, and to determine whether it's a "fit" for them.

With this goal in mind, ElfHosted will not issue refunds for "unsuitability" of the platform, if users "change their mind" during their subscription term. If the platform is unsuitable, users should have discovered this within their 7-day trial period.

Packages without trials periods (*Rangers, Halflings, Nazguls*) are not eligible for discretionary refunds. Users wanting to "test the waters" should start on a trial package and upgrade to a larger package when they're satisfied and willing to commit.

## Cancellation

A cancelled subscription will persist until the subscription renewal date, in a "pending-cancel" state, but won't be renewed.

## Refunds

While we reserve the right to make exceptions to this rule based on individual circumstances, refunds are intended for instances when ElfHosted is entirely responsible for the unsuitability of a service, for example, the withdrawl of a particular application or product.

While ElfHosted will, in good faith, attempt to resolve issues, events outside of ElfHosted's direct control, such as policy or technical changes to 3rd parties (*Plex, RealDebrid, etc*) which render the service unusable, will **not** constitute as grounds for a refund.

To be clear, the following are example cases under which you will **not** receive a refund:

* RealDebrid bans your account
* Plex block our IP / VPN ranges
* RealDebrid makes technical changes which renders the service unusable
* You replace your smart TV and streaming no longer works well
* Our datacenter providers suspend services or make changes which render the service unusable (*in this case, we would in good faith, move services to alternative providers*)
