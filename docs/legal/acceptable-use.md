ElfHosted provides consumer-grade application hosting only—we do not supply media, and we do not permit commercial redistribution of the services without written authorization. By using ElfHosted, you agree to abide by the rules below and any other guidance communicated by our team.

> Reminder: ElfHosted is for personal, household workflows. Running commercial workloads, reselling seats, or operating a content service for others is prohibited unless we provide written permission.

## Vexation & Harassment

ElfHosted does not tolerate any harassment, malice or abuse towards it’s employees or subsidiaries. Any form of harassment, cursing, threats, or ill will directed towards ElfHosted staff or authorized agents shall not be tolerated.

The Customer agrees to conduct themselves in a professional manner regardless of the method of communication with ElfHosted. Should the Customer be found in violation of this clause ElfHosted reserves the right to suspend or terminate services with or without prior notice and without liability.

## Network & security abuse

ElfHosted does not allow, condone, or authorize any form of network abuse. Examples include denial-of-service attacks, credential stuffing, phishing, scanning or crawling other users’ services, running open proxies or VPN resale nodes, botnet control, crypto-mining, spamming, or distributing malware.

You may not engage in illegal, abusive, or irresponsible behavior, including but not limited to:

* Unauthorized access to or use of data, systems, or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures (including those belonging to ElfHosted and its customers) without express authorization of the owner of the system or network.
* Monitoring data or traffic on any network or system without the authorization of the owner of the system or network.
* Use of an Internet account or computer without the owner’s authorization, including, but not limited to internet scanning, password harvesting, security-hole scanning, or port scanning.
* Any conduct that is likely to result in retaliation against the ElfHosted network.
* Use of ElfHosted’s network in a way that unreasonably interferes with other customers’ use of the network, including excessive automation, bulk unsolicited messaging, or bandwidth hoarding beyond your plan’s intended scope.
* Hosting or distributing malicious code, command-and-control infrastructure, or software designed to defeat copyright protection or security controls.

## Fair Use Policy

### Shared infrastructure

ElfHosted’s shared clusters depend on fair behavior. If a customer uses excessive resources (CPU, RAM, disk, network, or GPU) in a way that degrades other users’ experience, ElfHosted may throttle, restart, isolate, or migrate the workload without notice. Unsupported scripts or user actions that continuously consume disproportionate resources may trigger warnings; failure to remediate can lead to service suspension or termination. 4K transcoding on shared GPUs is prohibited unless explicitly stated in your plan.

### Security

You must take reasonable security precautions. Keep credentials secret, rotate them periodically, and enable multi-factor authentication wherever offered. You are responsible for actions taken under your account, even if performed by someone else due to weak passwords or credential reuse.

### Abuse tickets & disclosure

ElfHosted’s standard policy is to contact the customer when a violation of the AUP or Terms of Service has occurred; however, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate an account with or without notice at our discretion. The customer agrees to maintain up-to-date contact information. Notices will be sent from <mailto:legal@elfhosted.com> (or our helpdesk) and will specify the violation and the remediation window—typically acknowledgement within 24 hours and remediation windows ranging from immediate action to 48 hours depending on severity. Failure to respond within the stated window may result in automatic suspension. ElfHosted may share relevant logs or account details with upstream providers or law enforcement when required by law or to resolve abusive activity. For details on how we process abuse complaints, see the [Abuse Policy](/legal/abuse/), and for copyright takedowns see the [Notice & Takedown policy](/legal/takedownnotice/).

### Resource Abuse

We will investigate reports of resource abuse and provide a best-effort analysis of the underlying cause. Customers will have a defined remediation window to adjust code, scripts, or workloads. If the issue persists, ElfHosted may disable plugins, themes, services, or entire accounts; migrate workloads to isolated hardware; or permanently terminate service, depending on severity. Examples are illustrative, not exhaustive—ElfHosted reserves full discretion in interpreting and enforcing this AUP.

## Disclaimer

ElfHosted is under no duty, and does not by this AUP undertake a duty, to monitor or police our customers’ activities and disclaims any responsibility for any misuse of the ElfHosted network.
