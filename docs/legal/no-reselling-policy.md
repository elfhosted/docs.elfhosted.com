# Reselling Policy

ElfHosted services are intended for personal, consumer use. While sharing your services with friends and family is within the accepted expected use of the service, any form of reselling of ElfHosted services (*i.e., "Plex shares"*) is strictly prohibited, and will result in account termination without refund.

## Is "splitting the bill" reselling?

Think of the question of reselling vs sharing like splitting the bill for a meal at a restaurant. It's perfectly reasonable to split the bill for an all-you-can-eat buffet meal with your family, but it would be entirely unacceptable to request that meal in 100 take-away bags, and to sell it on the street outside!
