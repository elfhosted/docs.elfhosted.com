# Reselling Policy

**Effective Date:** 19 Dec 2025

ElfHosted services are intended for personal, consumer use. You may share access with members of your immediate household or close family (“sharing”) provided no money changes hands beyond splitting the original bill and everyone uses the service under your supervision. Any form of **reselling**, sublicensing, seat-leasing, or advertising ElfHosted access to the public (including “Plex shares,” Discord/Telegram group buys, Patreon tiers, donations for access, or bundling ElfHosted seats inside another product) is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate suspension or termination without refund. ElfHosted deploys and manages applications only - we do not provide or curate content for redistribution, and you may not use our platform to deliver managed services or media libraries to customers or strangers.

## Is "splitting the bill" reselling?

Think of the question of reselling vs sharing like splitting the bill for a meal at a restaurant. It's perfectly reasonable to split the bill for an all-you-can-eat buffet meal with your family, but it would be entirely unacceptable to request that meal in 100 take-away bags, and to sell it on the street outside!

## Examples

Allowed (sharing):

- Spouse, partner, or children in the same household using your hosted apps under your main login.
- Long-term friend/relative casually chipping in for half the monthly bill, with no public advertisement.

Not allowed (reselling):

- Posting “Plex shares” or “ElfHosted slots” on social media, Discord, Telegram, or reseller forums.
- Collecting recurring donations, Patreon subscriptions, or “coffee money” in exchange for login details.
- Packaging ElfHosted services as part of a commercial bundle, consulting package, or hosted offering for clients.
- Managing more than a small number of unrelated accounts or devices on behalf of paying strangers.

## Enforcement actions

Violations of this policy also breach our [Terms of Service](/legal/terms-of-service/), [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use/), and [No Piracy Policy](/legal/no-piracy-policy/). We reserve the right to:

- Suspend or terminate services without refund.
- Remove or archive associated data immediately.
- Blacklist payment methods, accounts, or related domains from future purchases.
- Report egregious abuse to upstream providers, payment processors, or relevant authorities.

Appeals are considered only for first-time misunderstandings where customers promptly demonstrate compliance. Repeat or intentional resellers are permanently banned.
