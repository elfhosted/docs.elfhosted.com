# ElfHosted Abuse Policy

**Effective Date:** 21 May 2025  
**Contact:** [abuse@elfhosted.com](mailto:abuse@elfhosted.com)

At **Elfhosted**, we provide infrastructure for users to host and deploy their own applications. We **do not provide, curate, or manage any content** accessible through these applications. All content is entirely **user-provided**, or obtained through **third-party APIs that scrape publicly available data**. As a result, Elfhosted disclaims all responsibility for the content or behavior of any user or application on the platform.

---

## 1. Content Responsibility

- **Elfhosted does not host or serve any original content.**  
  All media, metadata, links, or search results seen through hosted applications are either:
  - Provided by the user themselves, or
  - Fetched via APIs from public sources by the user‚Äôs configuration.

- **User-Controlled Deployments**: Each user is responsible for the applications they deploy and any resulting behavior or data output.

- **No Monitoring or Moderation**: Elfhosted does not monitor or moderate application content or activity.

---

## 2. Reporting Abuse

If you believe a user of our platform is engaging in illegal activity or violating acceptable use norms (e.g. malware, phishing, harassment, copyright infringement, etc.), please send a detailed report to:

Your report should include:

- A clear description of the issue  
- The affected service URL or domain (if applicable)

## 3. Enforcement Actions

Upon receiving a valid abuse report:

- We will acknowledge and review the report.
- If we determine a user is violating applicable laws, our Terms of Service, or causing harm via misuse of the platform, we may take **account-level action**.

‚ùå **We do not disable or intervene in individual applications.**  
‚úÖ **We reserve the right to suspend or terminate user accounts** that are found to be in violation.

## 4. Legal Requests

We comply with valid legal process, including subpoenas, warrants, and court orders.
