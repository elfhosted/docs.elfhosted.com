## The back-story

> I love self-hosting[^1], and have been publishing [guides on building self-hosting platforms and running apps](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz) since 2016. Over time, I've updated my own platform from [Docker Swarm](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/docker-swarm/) to [Kubernetes](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/kubernetes/) (*several iterations*).

> Somewhere along the way, building automated / resilient / scalable systems in Kubernetes became my [DayJob(tm)](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/work-with-me), and I spent 2 years consulting/co-investing in a seedbox provider. 

> When this provider shut down, I took the opportunity to take my self-hosting to the next level. I leveraged what I'd built / learned over those past 2 years to build ElfHosted - a multi-tenant, resilient, automated and scalable app hosting platform, running on "budget" bare-metal cloud hardware. I wanted to be able to rapidly deploy new self-hosted apps in a templatized way, and I wanted to invite other geeks to join in / observe the process.

## But.. but..

### ElfHosted vs Selfhosting

Question:
> "Why wouldn't I just run the app myself?"

Answer:

Totally valid. Here are some guides I wrote for doing just that on [Docker Swarm](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/docker-swarm/) or [Kubernetes](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/kubernetes/).

ElfHosted is for users (*like me, post-kids!*) who don't necessarily have the time / inclination to run (*and maintain!*) certain apps locally, want it to "Just Work(tm)".

[^1]: Defined as controlling and managing the apps I use, regardless of where they run
