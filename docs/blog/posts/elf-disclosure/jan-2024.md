# Elf-Disclosure for Jan 2024 now available

We're ðŸ‘¶ 6-months old now, and I've just finished our first Elf-Disclosure report from 2024!

Here's an excerpt:

> January saw us pivot away from "traditional" seedbox hosting and towards the exciting debrid-based "infinite streaming" space. You'll notice that while hardware costs remained mostly stable (this will not be true in February, I'm afraid!), development costs (our most costly expense!) doubled, as we introduced a slew of new apps and guides to capitalize on this increased interest.

You can read about all the changes, expenses vs income, and geek out over the tech stats, in the [Elf-Disclosure for Jan 2024](/open/jan-2024/) report!
