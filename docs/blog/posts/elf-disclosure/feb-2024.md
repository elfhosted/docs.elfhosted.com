# ElfReport for Feb 2024 now available

We're 7-months old now, starting to outgrow our (*1Gbps*) baby :baby: clothes, and exploring a new service niche, the hosted Stremio addons! Our Feb 2024 report is now [published](/open/feb-2024/)!

Here's an excerpt:

> February saw us outgrowing our 1Gbps storage nodes, and becoming more involved in the [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons) community, moving from hosting a [single hacky alternative](https://torrentio.elfhosted.com) for the popular-but-overloaded torrentio service, to providing free / subscription hosting for [many popular Stremio Addons](/stremio-addons/).

## Highlights from February 2024

* 8 Popular Stremio Addons are [now ElfHosted](/open/feb-2024/#stremio-addons)
* AllDebrid is now [properly supported](/open/feb-2024/#alldebrid-support)
* [Symlink-based downloading/streaming](/open/feb-2024/#symlinks-supercharged) is supercharged

## Upcoming in March 2024

* Regular price re-balancing to [start from 1 April 2024](/open/feb-2024/#regular-pricing-re-balancing-starts-1-april-2024)
* [Improved issue/bug/backlog mananagement](/open/feb-2024/#backlog-management) via GitHub
* [Plex library migrations](/open/feb-2024/#plex-library-migrations) for improved speed
* [PostgreSQL support](/open/feb-2024/#postgresql-support-for-the-aars) for the Aars
