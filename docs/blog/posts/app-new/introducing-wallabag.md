# G'day, Wallabag! :kangaroo:

Today's new app is an old open-source classic (*which is still receiving regular maintenance, updates, and new features*), [Wallabag][wallabag], an excellent, feature-full read-it-later app:

## What's new? ##

### New Toyz ###

I was taken to task in r/selfhosted for "[not enough cute elves](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/188vbuc/how_to_selfhost_online_a_tool_for_1_euro_or_less/kbor6a9/?context=10000)" on the ElfHosted page.

Taking this to heart, I commissioned a "cute mascot", whose presence now graces your dashboards, our docs, store, and emails.

<figure markdown>
  ![](images/../../../../images/logo.svg){ width="250" }
  <figcaption>Isn't he cute? <br/>(I asked for "nerdy elf holding servers")</figcaption>
</figure>

Since I had a new logo, I also tweaked the colors on our website / emails, so your future online interactions should be a little more polished / professional!

### Bugz squished

#### Minor rclone-encrypted bugs squished

Yesterday's toyz is today's bugz - there were some edge cases re the new storagebox / gdrive encrypted mounts which caused some trouble today - I'm not sure that we've caught all the issues, so if you're an encrypted rclone mount user, and something doesn't work the way you think it should, let me know!

### Summary

As always, thanks for building with us - feel free to share suggestions, and your own ideas for new apps to add!
