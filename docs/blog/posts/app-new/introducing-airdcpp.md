# Introducing AirDC++

After some careful user testing (*thanks \@lath!*), [AirDC++][airdcpp] is generally available!

AirDC++ (Web Client) is a modern client for the "[Advanced Direct Connect Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Connect_(protocol))", a protocol with a 25-year backstory, which allows creating file sharing communities with thousands of users. Among other things, AirDC++ is popular with comic-book-sharing communities.

## New Features

### \@Layezee's TRaSH Guides

Thanks to \@LayeZee, we now have dedicated guides to configuring Radarr / Sonarr with the TRaSH guides custom formats, for 1080P content.

For details, see:

* [Optimizing your movie quality with TRaSH Guides custom formats](/guides/media/optimize-movie-quality-with-trash-custom-formats/)
* [Optimizing your series quality with TRaSH Guides custom formats](/guides/media/optimize-series-quality-with-trash-custom-formats/)

### ElfBot talks TRaSH

Don't fancy copying/pasting all that JSON, but still want to take advantage of the TRaSH magic to grab optimal content with your Aaars?

[ElfBot][elfbot] has [Recyclarr][recyclarr] built-in now, so you can get 98% of the way there by just running `elfbot recyclarr sync` :thumbsup:

### Jellyfin bumped to 3Gi RAM limit

We've started to see the occasional Jellyfin pod get OOMKilled due to reaching its 2Gi RAM limit (*during analysis*). The RAM limit for Jellyfin has been bumped up to 3Gi ðŸŽ‰

### Summary

Thanks for geeking out with us, and please share these posts with related geeks!
