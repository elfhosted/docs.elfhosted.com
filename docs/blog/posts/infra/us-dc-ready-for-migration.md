# US DC ready for (BETA) migrations

## Launch your Elf-spedition!

ElfHosted's default datacenter is located in the EU, which may not result in the best performance for users in other parts of the world.

We're expanding to other regions, and this guide will show you how to migrate your ElfHosted services between regions...

After several weeks of alpha-testing, our US-based datacenter is ready for more beta-testers!

To see whether you're a candidate for relocation, check your speed at [here](https://speed.elfhosted.com), and if a migration would be favorable, review the detailed instructions in [this guide](/how-to/migrate-datacenters/)

## Store theme updates

One of the feedback items from our recent survey was that the store was relatively hard to use / navigate. So we're working through a theming / structure updated, which in the short term, may have made it **harder** to navigate! :man_facepalming

If you notice anything out-of-place in the store, feel free to drop a note into the [Discord thread established specifically for this purpose](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1285001018328748063)!

## ElfReport for Aug 2024 released

In case you missed it, our [ElfReport report for Aug 2024](https://elfhosted.com/open/aug-2024/) was published 2 weeks ago, full of juicy stats, and notably the calculation that we covered our cash expenses in Aug!

## Summary
