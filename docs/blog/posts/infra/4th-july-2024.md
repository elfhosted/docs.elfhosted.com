# Happy 4th July, Americans!

As a non-American, I have been advised that 4th July requires fireworks and screenings of "Jaws". \@BSM made us this happily little image to celebrate:

![](/images/blog/happy-4th-july.png)

Inspired by the weird scary-shark-movie tradition :shark:, I've added coupon code `SHARKBAIT24` to the store, giving 4.7% discount to celebrate (*expires 6th July*).

## Jun 2024's Elf-Disclosure report published

Our [Elf-Disclosure report for June 2024](/open/jun-2024/) is now published. It's a long read, so buckle up! Also, this is the first month we've had a previous **year's** report to reflect back on. To see how far we've come, compare with the [June 2023 Elf-Disclosure](/open/jun-2023/) report!

!!! warning "Grandfathered subscription pricing deprecated from 1 Aug"
    
    For reasons outlined [here](/open/jun-2024/#no-more-grandfathered-pricing), from 1 Aug, any remaining grandfathered subscriptions will be repriced on renewal to match current rates (*this note will accompany all blog posts during July 2024*).

## ElfHosted supports Riven

There's some complicated math in the [Elf-Disclosure report](/open/jun-2024/#riven-rises), but the TL;DR is that ElfHosted subscriptions resulted in a revenue-sharing  sponsorship of $52 to the devs in June! :heart:

(*If you'd like to support Riven in addition to the 30% of your subscription, join me in sponsoring [here](https://github.com/sponsors/dreulavelle)*)

## Coming up..

Look forward to updates in the near future re Comet (*a new Stremio addon*), a trial of our US cluster (*I registered `elfhosted.us` today*), and an improvement in the store layout / structure! :)
