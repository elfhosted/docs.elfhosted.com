# Our Elf-erral program, 10% for life!

Having a base platform nice and stable, we're now looking for more users, and one option I'm going to try is a referral ("elf-erral") program. The plan may be subject to change, depending on how the plugin / user flow actually works, but for now, here's the deal:

1. Every user gets a unique referral URL, both on their "[my account](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/myreferrals/)" page, and on every product page in the store.
2. When a someone (*not you!*) **uses** your referal link, signs up, exhausts their free $10 ElfBuckz, and then tops up their ElfBuckz balance, you get 10% of all their future ElfBuckz top-ups. For life.

Given the minimum ElfBuckz top-up is $10, if you refer 10 users, you'll end up with at least $10 (*10 x 10% of $10*) credit to use for... buying more ElfBuckz! ðŸ’ª

## High-level guide for an ElfHosted media server

Asked by some of our Elfies in Discord for a quick blurb for inviting friends, I drafted a guide rere using ElfHosted to build a media server/stack. I fear it may still be too technical - the target audience would be tech-savvy friends want to do all the geeky media magic, but don't particularly care for the expenses/time/effort involved in self-hosting the apps at home.

If you have any suggestions on how to improve the guide, don't be shy!

## qBittorrent VPN interface fixed

qBittorrent will now automatically set itself to use the appropriate VPN interface on startup, which should deal with any "restart stalls" you may have noticed!

Thanks for building with us - stay tuned!
