## How do I use it?

### Port-Forwarding Required

Depending on your VPN provider, you may or may not get a port-forward assigned to your AirDC++ instance. Without a working port, your client will be in "passive" mode, still able to download (but from a smaller pool of users), and may possibly be banned from some hubs.

More details on "*why active mode*" [here](https://dcplusplus.sourceforge.io/webhelp/faq_whyactive.html)
