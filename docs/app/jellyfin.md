## How do I use it?

When you first connect, you'll be prompted to configure your admin account, setup your libraries, etc.

### Enable Hardware transcoding

Our nodes support Intel QuickSync for Video (QSV). Enable this under the admin dashboard's Playback settings.

### From media players

When you configure the Jellyfin app in your media player, use `https://<username>-jellyfin.elfhosted.com` as the address (*if a port is required, use `443`*)

## Solutions to common issues

### Playback stalls

Jellyfin may be trying to transcode the media, based on a detected incompatibilty with your client/app, and running into CPU limitations. For optimal performance and quality, try to direct-play media where possible. You could also try enabling hardware transcoding (*above*), which will improve transcoding performance.

### Test your speed

To test your streaming speed to your Jellyfin instance, browse to `https://<your username>-jellyfin.elfhosted.com/speed/` to perform a speedtest.
