## How do I use it?

Upon launch, you'll be prompted to create a username/password. Once this is completed, you'll be able to access the app, and configure your users, libraries, etc.

You may need to mount external storage to store your Audiobooks, using [rclone][rclone], if you're not storing your Audiobooks on an existing cloud storage provider, like [Real-Debrid][real-debrid].
