NZBGet is an efficient usenet downloader

{% include 'app.md' %}
{% include 'app_access.md' %}

## How do I use it?

The default of the configuration is already fine-tuned for our environment (*so take care making changes!*), but you'll want to configure your own news servers before NZBGet will download anything.

## How does /tmp work?

!!! warning
    Because `/tmp` is on a tmpfs (*to make it uber-fast to download and unpack, before transferring to storage*), if you restart the pod, you'll lose everything currently in `/tmp`. If you're going to restart NZBGet, you'll want to pause downloads, ensure that any pending downloads have been moved to `/storage`, and **then** perform the restart.
