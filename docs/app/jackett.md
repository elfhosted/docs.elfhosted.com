# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (*[Sonarr][sonarr], [Radarr][radarr], etc.*) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html or json response, and then sends results back to the requesting software. 

This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.

Specifically, Jackett, combined with [Stremio-Jackett][stremio-jackett], is one half of a [popular integration enabling streaming of content from Debrid providers via Stremio](/guides/media/stream-from-real-debrid-with-stremio-jackett).

## How do I use it?

### Adding Flaresolverr

Some indexers behind Cloudflare DDOS protection require [Flaresolverr][flaresolverr].

Once Flaresolverr is added to your account, configure it in Jackett simply as `https://flaresolverr:`

!!! warning "Jackett will restart"
    Jackett doesn't warn you, but applying configurations changes will cause it to restart. If your browser window reloads on a 502 error, wait a minute or two, and then retry.
