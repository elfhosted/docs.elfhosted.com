# {{ page.meta.slug }}

PlexTraktSync adds a two-way-sync between trakt.tv and Plex Media Server. This app is a standalone instance, which runs continuously in "watch" mode, as opposed to the one-time "sync" mode built into ElfTerm.

!!! note
    If you don't **need** continuous sync, you can simple use the `plextraktsync` command built into [ElfTerm][elfterm]
