# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Prowlarr is an indexer manager/proxy built on the popular arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports management of both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. 

It integrates seamlessly with [Lidarr][lidarr], [Mylar][mylar], [Radarr][radarr], [Readarr][readarr], and [Sonarr][sonarr], offering complete management of your indexers with no per app indexer setup required.

## How do I use it?

### Adding torrents.io

An custom indexer has been setup for torrents.io, the name of the indexer, confusingly, is "torrentsio" :grin:

### Enabling apps

All the supported apps are pre-configured in Prowlarr, but set to a disabled state. To enable Radarr and Sonarr, for example, you'd edit each disabled app, check the "**Enabled**" checkbox, and test and save. 

Then "Sync app indexers" to have Prowlarr sync your indexers to the supported, enabled apps :thumbsup:
