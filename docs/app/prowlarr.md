# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Prowlarr is an indexer manager/proxy built on the popular arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports management of both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. 

It integrates seamlessly with [Lidarr][lidarr], [Mylar][mylar], [Radarr][radarr], [Readarr][readarr], and [Sonarr][sonarr], offering complete management of your indexers with no per app indexer setup required.

## How do I use it?

### Adding torrentio

There are two custom indexers pre-provisioned with Prowlarr.. one is for the public Torrentio, which is significantly rate-limited, and the other is for the ElfHosted internal instance, which is free and unrestricted to all ElfHosted apps.

Search for "torrentio" to find and setup the indexers:

### Enabling apps

All the supported apps are pre-configured in Prowlarr, but set to a disabled state. To enable Radarr and Sonarr, for example, you'd edit each disabled app, check the "**Enabled**" checkbox, and test and save. 

Then "Sync app indexers" to have Prowlarr sync your indexers to the supported, enabled apps :thumbsup:

### External access (i.e. TorBox)

To enable access to your Prowlarr instance from outside of ElfHosted's infrastructure (*i.e., from a [TorBox](https://torbox.app) account*), you'll need to change your preconfigured API key, and add the [Prowlarr Exposed](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/prowlarr-exposed/) product to your subscription.

The "exposed" product explicitly disables SSO for Prowlarr's API, allowing Prowlarr's API (*but not web UI, so there's no need for extra authentication*) to be accessed externally, as illustrated below:
