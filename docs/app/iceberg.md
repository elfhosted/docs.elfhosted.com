# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Iceberg is a rewrite of [plex-debrid][plex-debrid], enabling Plex torrent streaming through Real Debrid and 3rd party services like Overseerr, Mdblist, etc.

!!! warning "Under active development"
    Iceberg is under active development, and may break at any time. Users are welcome to try it out (*it's $0 in the store provided you already have [Zurg][zurg]*), but should have realistic expectations of support and reliability!

[^1]: No, that's not a typo, it's a [Kubernetes service](https://github.com/funkypenguin/elf-infra/blob/ci/torrentio/service-elfhosted.yaml) called `elfhosted` in the namespace `torrentio`, on port `80`!
