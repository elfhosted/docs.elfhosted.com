ListSync automatically syncs your watchlists from IMDb, Trakt, and Letterboxd with Overseerr/Jellyseerr. No more manual adding - just add movies and shows to your favorite watchlist, and they'll appear in your media server automatically.

!!! tip "list-sync gets revenue sharing! :heart:"
    List-Sync is an "Elf-illiated" project - the developer maintains an active support channel ([#elf-list-sync](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1357211427013791836)) in our [Discord][discord] community, the app itself is tuned to work perfectly with ElfHosted "out-of-the-box", and 33% of your subscriptions are contributed to the developer!
