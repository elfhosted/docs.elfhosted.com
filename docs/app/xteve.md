## How do I use it

### Connecting to Plex

Because we run Plex behind a VPN, it's not possible for Plex to "see" xteve by name. However, we can use its Kubernetes service IP address, which doesn't change for the life of the service (*it'll change if you uninstall and reinstall though!*)

To get the IP of your xteve service, use [Kubernetes Dashboard][kubernetes-dashboard], search for `xteve`, and look for the ClusterIP of the **service**, as illustrated below:

Then use the cluster IP to connect Plex to XTeve, in the syntax `http://<IP>:33400`
