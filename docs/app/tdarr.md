Tdarr will batch-transcode your media, for efficient storage and maximum-compatibility streaming. Tdarr utilizes unused CPU / GPU capacity across our platform to perform batch transcodes, keeping your library lean and mean!

## How to use Tdarr

Tdarr is powerful and flexible, and can be intimidating to configure. Our instance is pre-configured to work as best as possible with our hardware / resources, but this section will detail some of the important configurations necessary.

### Worker setup

The following is required for the worker component of Tdarr:

#### Configure node

From the main Tdarr window, select the node, set 1 GPU transcode and 1 CPU healthcheck, and then click `Options` to add node-specific config:

#### Node options

Set the hardware encoding type to `vaapi`, allow the GPU worker to do CPU tasks, and set a low priority for FFMpeg/handbreak tasks:

#### Staging section 

Back on the main Tdarr page, under `Staging Section`, ensure that `Auto accept successful transcodes` is checked (*without this, the transcoded file will sit in `/transcodes` waiting manual approval, eventually filling up the `/transcodes` volume and crashing the pod*):

### Library setup

Each library which you want Tdarr to process needs to be setup as follows:

#### Source

For each source folder, ensure that the following options are checked for optimum performance:

#### Transcode cache

The `Transcode cache` section **must** be set to `/transcode`:

### Transcode options

Your may require a custom combination of plugins, but the transcoding plugin which works best with our QSV hardware is the one highlighted below:
