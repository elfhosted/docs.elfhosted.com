## How do I use it?

!!! warning "Under active development"
    Be aware that stremio-jackett is under **rapid** development, so some features may change / break over time. It's also a little awkward to use in some cases (*you can't edit your addon, for example, you have to uninstall and reinstall*)

First, setup [Jackett][jackett], by adding your indexers, and copying your API key.

Next, navigate to **Stremio Jackett** from your ElfHosted dashboard, and enter your [Real-Debrid][real-debrid] API key, as well as your Jackett API key:

Click "**Install**", and allow your OS to open the link in Stremio!

That's it!
