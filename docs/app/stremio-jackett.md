# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Stremio is an ingenious [Stremio](https://strem.io) addon, developed by @aymene69 and @hyoretsu, which acts as the "glue" between Stremio and [Real-Debrid][real-debrid], using your own [Jackett][jackett] indexer to seek out suitable torrents, and your Real-Debrid API key to identify cached torrents.

This integration can be useful if you want to avoid relying on 3rd-party addons, or search your private trackers for content to stream to Stremio via Debrid or even directly!

The result is a beautifully polished Stremio experience across your devices, to instantly stream any available torrent, without relying on the (*often overloaded*) torrentio addon!

## How do I use it?

!!! warning "Under active development"
    Be aware that stremio-jackett is under **rapid** development, so some features may change / break over time. It's also a little awkward to use in some cases (*you can't edit your addon, for example, you have to uninstall and reinstall*)

First, setup [Jackett][jackett], by adding your indexers, and copying your API key.

Next, navigate to **Stremio Jackett** from your ElfHosted dashboard, and enter your [Real-Debrid][real-debrid] API key, as well as your Jackett API key:

Click "**Install**", and allow your OS to open the link in Stremio!

That's it!
