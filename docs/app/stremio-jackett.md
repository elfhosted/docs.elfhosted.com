# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Stremio is an ingenious [Stremio](https://strem.io) addon, developed by @aymene69 and @hyoretsu, which acts as the "glue" between Stremio and [Real-Debrid][real-debrid], using your own [Jackett][jackett] indexer to seek out suitable torrents, and your Real-Debrid API key to identify cached torrents.

This integration can be useful if you want to avoid relying on 3rd-party addons, or search your private trackers for content to stream to Stremio via Debrid or even directly!

The result is a beautifully polished Stremio experience across your devices, to instantly stream any available torrent, without relying on the (*often overloaded*) torrentio addon!

See our [step-by-step guide on configuring Stremio with Stremio-Jackett addon](/guides/media/stream-from-real-debrid-with-stremio-jackett)

## How do I use it?

!!! warning "Under active development"
    Be aware that stremio-jackett is under **rapid** development, so some features may change / break over time. It's also a little awkward to use in some cases (*you can't edit your addon, for example, you have to uninstall and reinstall*)

### Configure Jackett

First, setup [Jackett][jackett], by adding your indexers, and copying your API key.

### Configure the Addon

Next, navigate to **Stremio Jackett** from your ElfHosted dashboard, and enter your [Real-Debrid][real-debrid] API key, as well as your Jackett API key:

!!! tip
    It's not necessary to enter a Jackett URL, this is pre-configured for you

### Install the Addon!

Click "**Install**" to allow your OS to open the link in Stremio, or right-click the **Install** button, and copy the long `stremio://` URL, and paste it into your Stremio search bar.
