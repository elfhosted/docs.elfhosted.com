# {{ page.meta.slug }}

SeerrBridge is a browser automation tool that integrates Jellyseer/Overseerr with Debrid Media Manager. It listens to movie requests via Overseerr webhook. It automates the torrent search and download process using Debrid Media Manager via browser automation, which in turn, gets sent to Real-Debrid. This streamlines your media management, making it fast and efficient.

!!! tip "SeerrBridge gets revenue sharing! :heart:"
    SeerrBridge is an "Elf-illiated" project - the developer maintains an active support channel ([#elf-seerrbridge](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1345126741118550046)) in our [Discord][discord] community, the app itself is tuned to work perfectly with ElfHosted "out-of-the-box", and 33% of your subscriptions are contributed to the developer!

## How to use SeerrBridge

You'll need some unique environment variables before you launch SeerrBridge, as indicated below.

### SeerrBridge

While usually environment variables can be managed via [ElfBot][elfbot], since `RD_ACCESS_TOKEN` contains quotes and spaces, it's simpler and safer to bypass ElfBot, and create a ConfigMap directly in Kubernetes Dashboard.

From [Kubernetes Dashboard][kubernetes-dashboard], click the `+` icon to create a new resource:

![](/images/gluetun-configmap-1.png)

Copy the example YAML below, edit it to include the values you need for your config (*in the following sections*), and paste them in:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: elfbot-seerrbridge
data:
  RD_ACCESS_TOKEN: 'YOUR_RD_TOKEN_FROM_DMM'
  RD_CLIENT_ID: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  RD_CLIENT_SECRET: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
  RD_REFRESH_TOKEN: YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
  OVERSEERR_API_KEY: YOUR_OVERSEERR_TOKEN
```

!!! tip "Syntax matters"
    Ensure you enclose the **entire** `RD_ACCESS_TOKEN` value in single quotes, as illustrated above.

Save your changes to create the ConfigMap, and use [ElfTerm][elfterm] to run `elfbot restart seerrbridge` to restart.

If you need to make subsequent changes to the ConfigMap, find it under ConfigMaps and edit it directly. (*or use ElfBot for minor changes*)

### Overseerr

Navigate to your Overrseerr, to `Settings` -> `General` and retrieve your API key

!!! tip "Using an external Overseerr"
    The solution is designed to work seamlessly with your ElfHosted [Overseerr][overseerr] / [Jellyseerr][jellyseerr] instance, but if you want to interact with an existing, external 'seerr, you'll also want to set the `OVERSEERR_BASE` value in the `elfbot-seerrbridge` configmap, to point to your external 'seerr URL.

### DebridMediaManager

Navigate to https://debridmediamanager.com, and authenticate with RealDebrid.

In your browser, use developer tools to inspect the page, and capture your RealDebrid tokens from local storage, as illustrated below:

Google Chrome:

Firefox:

![](/images/seerrbridge_dmm_setup_firefox.png)

Use the values you find to prepare the following:

```
RD_ACCESS_TOKEN: '{"value":"your_token","expiry":123}'
RD_CLIENT_ID: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
RD_CLIENT_SECRET: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
RD_REFRESH_TOKEN: YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
```

#### Filtering (optional)

The [upstream docs](https://github.com/Woahai321/SeerrBridge?tab=readme-ov-file#-custom-regex-filtering) provide details about how search results can be filtered by using regexs.

As of v0.4.5, a global maximum for movie and episode size can also be set.

Optionally, edit your ConfigMap to apply the following values:

```
  MAX_MOVIE_SIZE: "60"
  MAX_EPISODE_SIZE: "5"
  TORRENT_FILTER_REGEX=^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```
