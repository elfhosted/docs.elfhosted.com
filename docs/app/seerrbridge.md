# {{ page.meta.slug }}

SeerrBridge is a browser automation tool that integrates Jellyseer/Overseerr with Debrid Media Manager. It listens to movie requests via Overseerr webhook. It automates the torrent search and download process using Debrid Media Manager via browser automation, which in turn, gets sent to Real-Debrid. This streamlines your media management, making it fast and efficient.

!!! tip "SeerrBridge gets revenue sharing! :heart:"
    SeerrBridge is an "Elf-illiated" project - the developer maintains an active support channel ([#elf-seerrbridge](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1345126741118550046)) in our [Discord][discord] community, the app itself is tuned to work perfectly with ElfHosted "out-of-the-box", and 33% of your subscriptions are contributed to the developer!

## How to use SeerrBridge

You'll need some unique environment variables before you launch SeerrBridge, as indicated below.

### Overseerr

Navigate to your Overrseerr, to `Settings` -> `General` and retrieve your API key

!!! tip "Using an external Overseerr"
    The solution is designed to work seamlessly with your ElfHosted [Overseerr][overseerr] / [Jellyseerr][jellyseerr] instance, but if you want to interact with an existing, external 'seerr, you'll also want to set the `OVERSEERR_BASE` using [ElfBot][elfbot], to point to your external 'seerr URL.

### DebridMediaManager

Navigate to https://debridmediamanager.com, and authenticate with RealDebrid.

In your browser, use developer tools to inspect the page, and capture your RealDebrid tokens from local storage, as illustrated below:

Google Chrome:

Firefox:

![](/images/seerrbridge_dmm_setup_firefox.png)

Use the values you find to prepare the following:

Now insert the values identified above into SeerrBridge's environment variables using [ElfBot][elfbot]:

``` title="Quick-paste into SeerrBridge's environment variables using ElfBot"
RD_ACCESS_TOKEN={"value":"your_token","expiry":123}
RD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
RD_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
RD_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
OVERSEERR_API_KEY=YOUR_OVERSEERR_TOKEN
```

#### Filtering (optional)

The [upstream docs](https://github.com/Woahai321/SeerrBridge?tab=readme-ov-file#-custom-regex-filtering) provide details about how search results can be filtered by using regexs.

As of v0.4.5, a global maximum for movie and episode size can also be set.

``` title="Quick-paste into SeerrBridge's environment variables using ElfBot"
MAX_MOVIE_SIZE: "60"
MAX_EPISODE_SIZE: "5"
TORRENT_FILTER_REGEX=^(?!.*„Äê.*?„Äë)(?!.*[\u0400-\u04FF])(?!.*\[esp\]).*
```
