!!! warning "Advanced use"
    plex_debrid is an advanced and complex tool, you should expect to spend some time troubleshooting!

    Further, plex_debrid requires an [rclone WebDAV mount](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/rclone-webdav-mount/) to your Debrid service, and if using Real-Debrid, you'll want [Zurg][zurg] plus the [Zurg-specific WebDAV mount](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/rclone-real-debrid/)!

## How do I use it ?

### Initial setup

plex_debrid is unusual in that it requires a CLI-based setup. For this reason, we run it within a VNC-based browser session. 

The first time you open plex_debrid, you'll be prompted with the "setup wizard". Go through the wizard and enter the necessary details as prompted.

ElfHosted-specific config steps are illustrated below:
