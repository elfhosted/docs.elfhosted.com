# {{ page.meta.slug }}

SuggestArr is a project designed to automate media content recommendations and download requests based on user activity in media servers like Jellyfin, Plex, and now Emby. 

It retrieves recently watched content, searches for similar titles using the TMDb API, and sends automated download requests to Jellyseer or Overseer.

## How to use it

Requirements

You'll need:

* [x] A streamer (*either [Plex][plex], [Emby][emby], or [Jellyfin][jellyfin])*)
* [x] Either [Overseerr][overseerr] or [Jellyseerr][jellyseerr]
* [x] A TMDB API key (*free, get it [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/)*) 

The SuggestAarr setup wizard will walk you through the following steps. At each step which requires configuration (API keys etc), it won't let you progress until its validated the settings. Take extra care when configuring your streamer URL, since the URL to use internally within ElfHosted is not a standard default.

### Step 1 / Pick Streamer

Pick your streamer:

### Step 2 / Setup TMDB

Enter and validate your TMDB API key:

### Step 3 / Setup Streamer

Validate your streamer (*will differ per-streamer*):

You may be warned that you're authorizing an device / application on a different IP to your own. This is expected, since SuggestAarr needs direct access to your Plex in order to scrape your watch history:

When configuring your streamer, use the **internal** URL, as follows:

* Plex: `http://plex:32400`
* Jellyfin: `http://jellyfin:8096`
* Emby: `http://emby:8096`

### Step 4 / Setup 'seerr

Setup Jellyseerr / Overseerr:

When configuring your 'seerr, use the **internal** URL, as follows:

* Overseerr: `http://overseerr:5055`
* Jellyseerr: `http://jellyseerr:5055`

Find your API key in your 'seerr, under `Settings -> General Settings`:

### Step 5 / Advanced Filter Configuration

Set your preferred TMDB rating threshold, filter out any genres you don't want, etc:

### Step 6 / Additional Configuration

Set final configuration, plus your cron schedule. Note that the app runs in the UTC timezone.

### Done ðŸŽ‰

When your setup is complete, your SuggestAarr UI should look something like this:
