# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Wizarr is an automatic user invitation system for Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby.
Create a unique invite link and share it with users — they’ll be automatically added to your media server and guided through downloading apps, accessing request systems, and more!

The problem: Inviting your Friends/Family to your Plex server Is complicated and tedious. It's also a hard concept for them to get their head around.

The solution: Wizarr makes it easy to invite users to your server by simply sending them a link, and guides them through the process of getting set up.
