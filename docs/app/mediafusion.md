# {{ page.meta.slug }}

MediaFusion (an alternative to torrentio stremio addon), is the most comprehensive and powerful of the Stremio Addons in 2024, especially popular for watching Tamil, Hindi, Malayalam, Kannada, English, and dubbed movies & series. ElfHosted provides a public, community version of MediaFusion at https://mediafusion.elfhosted.com (*with individual and global rate-limits*), and per-user, private, un-rate-limited instances.

## How do I use it?

### Newbie mode

### Pro mode

### Set the API password

Since MediaFusion v4, every instance **must** include an `api_password` ENV var, to secure the instance from unwanted public tampering. 

Every ElfHosted instance defaults its API password to `changemeelfie`, but you can (and should) reset this using [ElfBot][elfbot], by running:

```
elfbot env mediafusion api_password=whateveryouwant
```
