# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Storyteller is a platform for automatically aligning ebooks and audiobooks for immersive reading, with native [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.smoores.Storyteller) / [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/storyteller-reader/id6474467720) apps.

### Align your audiobooks and ebooks

Switch back and forth between listening and reading without losing your place, or have Storyteller read aloud to you while highlighting the text!

### Read or listen however you choose

Storyteller produces EPUB 3 compliant ebook files. You can read them with any ebook reader (software or hardware!) that supports EPUB Media Overlays, or you can use the dedicated Storyteller mobile apps.
