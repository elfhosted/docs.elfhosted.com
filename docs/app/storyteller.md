# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Storyteller is a platform for automatically aligning ebooks and audiobooks for immersive reading, with native [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.smoores.Storyteller) / [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/storyteller-reader/id6474467720) apps.

### Align your audiobooks and ebooks

Switch back and forth between listening and reading without losing your place, or have Storyteller read aloud to you while highlighting the text!

### Read or listen however you choose

Storyteller produces EPUB 3 compliant ebook files. You can read them with any ebook reader (software or hardware!) that supports EPUB Media Overlays, or you can use the dedicated Storyteller mobile apps.

## How to use Storyteller

### Set STORYTELLER_SECRET_KEY

Storyteller uses the `STORYTELLER_SECRET_KEY` environment variable to secure its authentication. While we provide a strong default, that default is applied to all users, and so you should reset your key before you configure Storyteller.

To set your `STORYTELLER_SECRET_KEY`, generate a strong random string using or [1Password's online random password generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/), or by running `openssl rand -base64 32`

``` title="Quick-paste into StoryTeller's environment variables using ElfBot"
STORYTELLER_SECRET_KEY=<your string here>
```

Storyteller will restart, and you can now proceed to setup your admin account.

### Transcription services

ElfHosted's Storyteller instances are limited to 1 CPU core, since our platform is not optimized for bulk transcoding activities. The transcription of an audiobook will therefore be **very** slow.

A viable alternative is to use a cloud transcription service - indicative prices are below:
