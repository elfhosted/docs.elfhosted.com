## How do I access {{ page.meta.slug }}?

Being a command-line tool, {{ page.meta.slug }} doesn't actually have a UI you can "log into". However, your dashboard (`https://<username>.elfhosted.com>`) will link you to the FileBrowser path to the config and the logs - you can also view the logs in realtime using [Kubernetes Dashboard][kubernetes-dashboard].

## Can I set env vars?

Yes, [use ElfBot to set your ENV vars](/app/elfbot/#how-to-set-an-env-var-for-an-app) - here's a [link to the official docs](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/pmm/environmental/) describing how to use environment variables.

You could, for example, use `elfbot env plexmetamanager PMM_TIMES=10:00,23:00` to configure Plex Meta Manager to run at 10am and 11pm (UTC) daily.
