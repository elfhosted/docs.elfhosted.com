## How do I access {{ page.meta.slug }}?

Being a command-line tool, {{ page.meta.slug }} doesn't actually have a UI you can "log into". However, your dashboard (`https://<username>.elfhosted.com>`) will link you to the FileBrowser path to the config and the logs - you can also view the logs in realtime using [Kubernetes Dashboard][kubernetes-dashboard].
