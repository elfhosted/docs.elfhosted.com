# "ElfReport" for Oct 2024

October saw the removal of Ceph from our DE cluster, after it was implicated in the third I/O outage, due to our offsite backup design. The US datacenter got 100% more capacity, we started doing 7-day free trials, weekly videos, and bundling our proxy-streaming Stremio addons to make them more attractive.

I'm happy to announce that this month we started contributing towards the development of Zurg, pushing our open source contributions above $1,200! :partying_face:

To get us started, here are some shiny stats for Oct 2024, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/) (*which we moved, during the month*)...

## Resources

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    The stats below illustrate CPU cores used (*not percentage*). These stats only cover the DE cluster at present, we're working on cross-cluster metrics aggregation to make this data more useful.
    
    The snapshot was taking an hour after the daily "glowup", and you can see the CPU impact of the rollout reflected in the graph.

    CPU load is lower than the previous month, contributing factors being the increased migration of users to the US cluster, and the [deprecation of Ceph](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/10/07/the-road-to-cephless/) and the [public Annatar instance](https://annatar-is-deprecated.elfhosted.com/), which consumed significant resources.

    !!! tip "Why Hansel & Gretel?"
        Bundles are datacenter-agnostic, but nodes are specific to each datacenter, and we needed a way to differentiate US nodes from DE nodes. The fairy tale of [Hansel and Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel) originates in Germany :flag_de:

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire (DE) cluster. Interestingly, tenant memory usage has is on par with last month, while CPU usage is significantly less. 

    Other high consumers of RAM:

    * **csi-rclone**: used for mounting all rclone-compatible storage mounts, primarily RealDebrid libraries
    * **kube-system**: the Kubernetes control plane, including the cilium agents which manage the networking / policy enforcement (*currently 11K flows/s across 30 nodes*)
    * **traefik**: all inbound access to the cluster / services
    * **kube-prometheus-stack**: our relatively un-optimized observability stack
    * **[mediafusion][mediafusion]**: an excellent (*but RAM-hungry!*) [Stremio addon](/stremio-addons/)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    The current trend seems to indicate that contended nodes (*hansels*) are constantly ~10% utilized (*predominantly by lightweight starter kits and Stremio addons*), while the dedicated nodes (*gretels*) peak at 50% utilization, but also revert to very low utilizatio (2%) when not in use. This is what we'd expect since the dedicated nodes are primarily about reserved capacity.

## Retrospective

### Cephless migration

In the first week of October, we suffered our third I/O "freeze", attributed to Ceph and our volsync daily offsite backup processes.

A day later, we published [our plan to take the DE cluster "cephless"](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/10/07/the-road-to-cephless/), like the US cluster, relying only on local storage and daily offsite backups, rather than complicated, expensive, and fragile network storage.

It took the remainder of the month to transition all the apps off of Ceph and onto TopoLVM-managed, local NVMe storage. We migrated user apps over about a week's worth of maintenance windows, and then migrated internal backend systems over the following few weeks. The last of the 10Gbps ceph nodes was decomissioned in the last week of October.

A few days later, we received notice of a rolling set of "urgent maintenance" windows planned by Hetzner in Nov/Dec (*more details [below](#hetzner-scheduled-maintenance)*), which would have necessitated a full shutdown of the DE cluster, if we were still using Ceph!

### US cluster

Since last month, the US cluster has grown from 20 to 33 users, and we've added 100% capacity for tenant workloads, plus 200% extra control-plane nodes, for high availability.

Here's what the US cluster looks like today (*compare this with the `kubectl top` output in the CPU/RAM sections above*):

```
NAME       CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
eagle01    359m         4%     10241Mi         32%
eagle02    210m         2%     4875Mi          15%
eagle03    127m         1%     3852Mi          12%
yankee01   1122m        14%    16163Mi         50%
yankee02   1246m        15%    20112Mi         63%
yankee03   2834m        35%    20589Mi         64%
yankee04   804m         10%    19631Mi         61%
yankee05   458m         5%     14240Mi         44%
yankee06   1385m        17%    18742Mi         58%
```

And here's what it looked like last month:

```
root@eagle01:~# k top nodes
NAME       CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
eagle01    475m         5%     10632Mi         33%
yankee01   2327m        29%    20906Mi         65%
yankee02   867m         10%    21798Mi         68%
yankee03   1130m        14%    19992Mi         62%
root@eagle01:~#
```

We've order another 7 yankees for the US DC in November - we may end up with excess capacity in the short term, but given the Black Friday / Christmas season approaches, and the inevitable delays of ordering hardware, I'd rather be over-prepared than under-prepared!

If you'd like to gauge whether the US cluster would be more suitable for your workloads, visit https://speed.elfhosted.com and perform some comparative tests!

### US East Coast DC

We don't have an ETA yet, but our US DC supplier have built out their Pennsylvania (PA) datacenter on the east coast, and we've indicated interest in establishing a presence there. With a PA datacenter on the east coast, and the existing WA datacenter on the west coast, we'd be better able to serve our US Elfies!

Please submit your suggestions for what the DNS suffix and node names should be!

### 7-day free trials are back

We did an experiment, and offered one-day demo instances for $1. These proved popular, but the feedback we received was that 24 hours is not (*at all!*) enough time to adequately test an ElfHosted stack.

So, we brought back 7-day free trials on [starter kits](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/starter/), [hobbits](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/hobbit), and [supplemental apps](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/apps/).

### Refund policy

Since users can now use 7-day free trials to "kick the tyres", we no longer offer unconditional 14-day refunds. The intention is that the trial period is used for testing, and once trial converts to a paid subscription, that subscription is paid for until the renewal period. This reduces support time / overhead, while providing what amounts to a generous ~25% off the first subscription for a "testing phase".

We now have a clear and concise [refund policy](https://elfhosted.com/legal/refund-policy/) explaining this.

### Pay it Forward

We want to make you so happy with your ElfHosted services, that you’ll tell your friends, as a favor to them (*not us)*, and now’s the perfect time to do so, since free trials are back!

To this end, we’ve redone the referral system (*it's a new plugin*) – each friend you refer will get $10 credit off a bundle, and (*for each paid order*) you’ll get $10 credit which will automatically be applied against your subscription.

For details and your own referral codes, just [Pay it Forward](https://store.elfhosted.com/pay-it-forward/)!

### Giveaways

We’ve created a new channel in [Discord][discord], to offer giveaways in a fair and automated fashion. @mhdzumair (*MediaFusion developer*) has been giving away vouchers for a month's AllDebrid subscription, and @layezee has plans to arrange more varied giveways in November.

To enter each giveaway, all you have to do is visit the [#elf-giveaways](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1296776882716414052) channel and click the “enter giveaway” button!

(*The giveaway bot function may switch to a Wordpress plugin, if we can find a suitable one!*)

### Maintenance window "glows up", shifts by 12h

We [shifted our maintenance window](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/10/14/maintenance-window-shifting-by-12h/) by 12 hours, to better suit the growing need for our team to be available after a maintenance period, in case of issues.

We've also no longer calling it a "maintenance window" - that's too gloomy and negative - we now call it, a "glow up" :star:, and it's got its own special channel in [#elf-glowup](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1300550510968836097)!

### $1 tier for non-apps (custom domains)

We adjusted the price on "non-apps" (*custom domains, exposed apps*) such that in most cases they're 90% more affordable, and "stalled" subscriptions (*for the handful which were previously $0/month*) no longer use up resources when abandoned, since the store never processed a renewal.

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/10/20/1-month-tier-aadded-for-non-apps/).

### Storage mounts are now free, self-service

Mounting storage into your pods has long been a complicated and fiddly process, with minor typos causing all pods to get stuck. As a result, storage mounts were priced at $9/month, given their propensity to spawn support tickets.

We've refactored how storage mounts work, such that they're now self-service and fail gracefully. This mean you can setup your own rclone-compatible storage mounts, and even if they fail (*because rclone isn't magic*), the rest of your services won't be impacted.

For more details, plus an instructional video, see [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/10/24/storage-mounts-are-now-free-and-self-service/).

### ElfBot does discretionary backups

Due to the Cephless migration, ElfBot is once again able to make on-demand backups of your apps! The backups are stored in a 10Gb volume at `/backups`, for you to manually transfer offsite.

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/10/10/elfbot-backup-is-back-up/).

### Debrid.News

Wanting a short-form way to track the rapidly-changing debrid ecosystem, we've established https://debrid.news. The idea is to collect debrid-related news in a short but sexy format, and make it available to subscribers as email newsletters.

It's not intended to be Elf-specific, but certainly Elf-related - if you've got an interest blogging / cosplaying Lois Lane / Jimmy Olsen, let me know!

### Stremio Proxy-Streaming more affordable

With the recent kerfuffle re RealDebrid’s hair-trigger ban-hammer, we’ve seen an increased interest in the Stremio Addons we host which provide “proxy streaming”, protecting users from inadvertent bans due to WiFi/Cellular/VPN switchover, shared account usage, and random VPN traffic redistribution.

We’ve also had recent feedback from users that the current pricing / options on these addons are (1) too expensive, and (2) too complicated.

So we’ve listened, and have been making some improvements, which you'll find described in details, [here](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/10/29/stremio-proxy-streaming-addons-purrrfected/).

Our goal is that a user can enjoy the full benefits of an addon with a single, reasonably-priced subscription, but upgrade to add more resources (bandwidth) as required.

### Mooar apps

It was a fairly slow month for new apps, given all the infrastructure changes, with the following notable exceptions:

#### Decluttarr

[Decluttarr](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/decluttarr/) keeps the radarr & sonarr & lidarr & readarr queue free of stalled / redundant downloads (*a common issue in debrid-aarr-land*)

Feature overview:

* Automatically delete downloads that are stuck downloading metadata (& trigger download from another source)
* Automatically delete failed downloads (& trigger download from another source)
* Automatically delete downloads belonging to radarr/sonarr/etc. items that have been deleted in the meantime (‘Orphan downloads’)
* Automatically delete stalled downloads, after they have been found to be stalled multiple times in a row (& trigger download from another source)
* Automatically delete slow downloads, after they have been found to be slow multiple times in a row (& trigger download from another source)
* Automatically delete downloads belonging to radarr/sonarr/etc. items that are unmonitored
* Automatically delete downloads that failed importing since they are not a format upgrade (i.e. a better version is already present)
    
#### ErstazTV

[ErsatzTV](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/ersatztv/) is beta software for configuring and streaming custom live channels using your media library. The software may be unstable and is under active development.

It can do clever things like create “virtual channels” from your existing Plex media, even inserting (although, why would you want to?) your own custom “commercials / fillers” between scheduled airings!

For further context, see [this Reddit discussion](https://reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/1g0yxx8/ersatztv_is_absolutely_awesome/).

#### ChannelsDVR

Unlike the mess which is Plex / Emby / Jellyfin + ThreadFin, [Channels DVR](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/channels-dvr/) is the modern, self-hosted IPTV solution. It’s priced accordingly ($8/month subscription from Channels themselves) – it’s a polished, supported, updated app with multi-platform support. You can use it to consume your (own) IPTV subscription, record live TV, and stream your stored media, either in the web browser or across loads of popular devices.

We’d previously had issues bringing Channels DVR to ElfHosted, because of a peculiarity of their setup, but @BSM has figured it out, and written a [detailed and clear guide](https://store.elfhosted.com/guides/channels-dvr/) on setting it up.

Your ElfHosted Channels DVR app subscription is classed as a “complex app”, given the transcoding, CPU, and bandwidth requirements it brings, and you can take advantage of the tiered pricing that bundled users get on all extra apps (*Rangers, for example, get 44% off*)

#### ImageMaid

Bundled free with [Kometa](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/kometa), ImageMaid is a CLI too clean up the extra overlays and images that Kometa creates, when it does its thing. If you’re a Kometa user, you should see ImageMaid appear on your apps dashboard after the next rollout.

You’ll need to generate and configure a Plex token in order to use it, but it’ll direct you on how to do this

## Coming up

### Hetzner scheduled maintenance

If you're in the DE cluster (*if your app URLs end in `.com`*), then at **some** point in the next 5 weeks, you'll be impacted by Hetzner's maintenance schedule, for up to 2 hours.

Take a look at [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/10/25/dodging-a-flurry-of-maintenance/), which lists affected nodes and dates, and includes links to status pages with calendar entries, to keep track of when your apps will be unavailable.

### Express checkout

The checkout process in our newly refreshed store is still clunky, and adds more friction than we'd like. Turning on the "next-gen" block-based checkout gives us "express checkout" with Apple/Google Pay, but it breaks ElfBuckz, and the ability for users to pick their own username on checkout.

I've found some documentation on migrating the ElfBuckz (Woocommerce Account Funds) plugin we use for block-based checkout support, so once I've solved this (and the small matter of allowing users to choose their own username on checkout), we should be able to switch over to express checkouts!

!!! question "Are you a Wordpress dev?"
    If you've got some expertise in this regard, and you'd like to help out, I'd appreciate any developer input!

### Even mooar apps

Apps currently requested can be found (and submitted!) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Notable coming-soons:

* [TitleCardMaker](https://titlecardmaker.com/) (*CLI version for now*)
* [Suggestarr](https://github.com/giuseppe99barchetta/SuggestArr) is a promising-looking app to automate media content recommendations and download requests based on user activity in media servers like Jellyfin, Plex, and now Emby. It retrieves recently watched content, searches for similar titles using the TMDb API, and sends automated download requests to Jellyseer or Overseer.

### Guide / blog refresh

While we've completed the migration of the blog from the docs site to the store, the refreshing of our guides is still on the short-term to-do list.

Now that we have a mostly-workable theme for the store, the ElfVengers and I will be moving much of the guides from the docs site (https://elfhosted.com) to the store, since this is more suitable for frequent, collaborative edits.

We're not sure yet exactly where the division should be, but the docs site should remain technical and price-agnostic, whereas the store should present what we offer, commercially, as simply and attractively as possible.

### Torbox Teamup (continues)

Wamy from [Torbox](https://torbox.app/) is keen to team up with us on a product bundle / offering to support ElfHosted Torbox users. We're still ironing out the details, but rather than trying to use Torbox to replace RD for gigantic-library-building, possible applications are:

1. Using your private trackers with the Aars for "infinite streaming Plex", while continuing to seed back and maintain your ratio.
2. Adding a "backup" debrid service for your most critical / popular content, so that you have a fallback in the event of RD rate-limits / changes.
3. Sourcing non-torrent, premium quality from Torbox's usenet sources.

In typical IT geek fashion, I've slightly widened the scope on this one to capture the creation of alternate packages to RealDebrid, including Torbox, DebridLink, and (*hopefully*) AllDebrid!

Stay [tuned](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/) for details!
