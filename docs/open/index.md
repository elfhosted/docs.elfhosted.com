# ElfHosted is Open Source

Our technical resources are open-source, and available for public inspection and input.

Part of the reason ElfHosted exists is to provide a "reference design" for similar platforms. If you want help doing something like this, [hit me up](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/work-with-me/) - it's my DayJob(tm)!

!!! question "What's missing?"
    Ha. Good question. What's **not** public is the repo which houses our user configs (*each user's particular combination of helm charts and values*), for obvious reasons, and all the secrets etc which make the magic work.
