# "ElfReport" for Apr 2025

During April, we made multiple, significant performance and functional improvements to the Aarr stacks, saw further features and updates applied to favorite apps like Pulsarr and SeerrBridge, and braced ourselves for the Plex-remote-streaming-pocalypse, which... hasn't really arrived.

To get us started, here are some geeky stats for Apr 2025, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/)...

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    The stats below illustrate CPU cores used (*not percentage*). These stats only cover the DE cluster at present, we're working on cross-cluster metrics aggregation to make this data more useful.

    Tenant CPU load on average is 5-10% higher than the preceding period, but overall CPU usage is lower due to some fixes / improvements in the supporting infrastructure components.

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire (DE) cluster. Tenant RAM usage has increased by ~20%, while CPU usage only increased 5-10%, which may be a result of the Aarr SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration detailed below.

    Other high consumers of RAM:

    * **csi-rclone**: used for mounting all rclone-compatible storage mounts, primarily RealDebrid libraries
    * **kube-system**: the Kubernetes control plane, including the cilium agents which manage the networking / policy enforcement (*currently 11K flows/s across 30 nodes*)
    * **traefik**: all inbound access to the cluster / services
    * **[mediafusion][mediafusion]**: an excellent (*but RAM-hungry!*) [Stremio addon](/stremio-addons/)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    Network usage during the snapshot period has increased from last month's snapshot, but given the changing nature of traffic patterns across the day / week, it's not possible to reach any conclusions about the changes from month-to-month. Rather, the graphs below indicate that our nodes are not contending for network throughput, and our per-tier egress rate-limits are being correctly enforced.
    
    !!! tip "Why Hansel & Gretel?"
        Bundles are datacenter-agnostic, but nodes are specific to each datacenter, and we needed a way to differentiate US nodes from DE nodes. The fairy tale of [Hansel and Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel) originates in Germany :flag_de:

## Retrospective

### Decypharr

Originally [announced in Mar 2025](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/03/27/decypharr-debridav-now-ga-symlink-cleaner-in-beta/), April saw us [bravely pivot](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/04/30/decypharr-beta-boosts-brilliantly-for-early-adopters/) to the "beta" branch of Decypharr, for improved config editing via the UI, and WebDAV support, which means that **Decypharr can now be used as a replacement for Zurg**.

!!! question "What's wrong with Zurg?"
    Nothing, it's more about what's wrong with **you** :stuck_out_tongue: - Currently, when Zurg detects changes to your RD library, it initiates a full refresh, which can take time - several minutes, on larger libraries. During this time, the contents of the RD folder are not refreshed, and so automated download tools (like.. decypharr) sit around for several minutes waiting for each "downloaded" item to appear in your RD mount.

    Since Decypharr's doing the downloading anyway, replacing Zurg with Decypharr makes this process totally internal, and thus Decypharr **instantly** "downloads" the target media, bypassing the zurg refresh-delay.

See more details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/04/30/decypharr-beta-boosts-brilliantly-for-early-adopters/).

### PostgreSQL

During April we carefully transition all our Radarr / Sonarr / Prowlarr instances from their native SQLite support, to PostgreSQL (*also native, but running independently of the Aarr*). Just like the Decypharr update above, this update was motivated by some of the "heavy-hitters", whose Aarr libraries were starting to slow down and thrash CPU based on the single-threaded nature of SQLite. 

Here to explain it more elegantly than I, is ChatGPT:

> When Radarr queues a hundred shows,
> And Sonarr scans where content goes,
> SQLite may start to groan and stall—
> A single thread can’t do it all.
> 
> But PostgreSQL, with power wide,
> Handles locks and reads with pride,
> Concurrency it does embrace,
> With queries flying—grace and pace.
> 
> So if your media starts to sprawl,
> And file scans echo through the hall,
> Let Postgres take the backend load—
> A smoother, faster data road.

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/04/14/bulk-up-your-aars-with-postgresql/).

### "The shim"

No, it's not a prison-fighting tool (*that's a "shank"*), and it's not a "she/him=shim" gender thing... in our case, it's a clever way to "trick" the Aars into processing symlinked debrid downloads without having to "ffprobe" each one, saving bandwidth and time when processing a large queue.

This time, I asked ChatGPT to rap a technical explanation for you:

> (Beat drops...)
> 🎤 Yo, listen up now, let me make this clear,
> We talkin’ 'bout shims, so lend me your ear.
> It ain’t a gender thing, don’t get it twisted,
> Not a prison shank, so scratch that off your wishlist.
> 
> A shim in tech—yo, it’s kinda sly,
> It slides in the middle when code goes awry.
> It’s a little piece of code, fills in the gap,
> Makes old stuff work with the new, no cap.
> 
> You got a program lookin’ for an old API?
> But your system changed and said “Goodbye”?
> That’s where a shim steps in on cue—
> Talks to both sides like a tech guru.
> 
> So next time someone says “I threw in a shim,”
> Don’t look confused, and don’t think grim.
> It’s just a smart fix, a compat’ layer win—
> Helping software talk, like it always been.

### Huntarr

Huntarr is a clever new tool which plugs yet-another gap in the Aaar workflow - it looks at your Aarr libraries, and "hunts" missing content. While this role was previously fulfilled by Scanarr (*shoutout to [Puks The Pirate](https://github.com/Pukabyte/scannarr)*), we've put Scannarr to bed and fully embraced the Huntarr!

All ElfHosted Aar users get Huntarr built into their bundles.

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/04/25/huntarrs-evolved-v5-arr-dbs-stablized/)

### Byparr

Flaresolverr is (was?) a tool for automatically "solving" CloudFlare CAPTCHAs employed by some indexers, so that automated tools like [Prowlarr][prowlarr] and [Jackett][jackett] can scrape them without human intervention. Flaresolverr hasn't worked well for a while now, and is unlikely to ever do so again.

[Byparr](https://github.com/ThePhaseless/Byparr) is a modern, drop-in replacement for Flaresolverr. We've "dropped it into" all the Flaresolverr bundles, so where you see `flaresolverr` in ElfHosted, it's actually Byparr, behind the scenes.

The change from Flaresolverr to Byparr has also allowed us to allocate less resources for "Flaresolverr", so you'll notice that it's now included by default with all Hobbit bundles (*previously only Ranger+*).

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/04/16/byparr-bypasses-flaresolverr/).

### SeerrBridge

We announced [SeerrBridge][seerrbridge] support last month, but the dev dropped a significant update in response to user requests - it's now possible to use SeerrBridge with **ongoing** TV shows, a huge QOL improvement for our initial beta-testers.

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/04/03/pulsarr-and-seerrbridge-get-supercharged/).

### Bundles Simplified

We've switched the format of the streaming bundles in the store over to "variable" products, which means that instead of 50+ possible product variations, there are now [only 6 streaming bundles](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/), each of which can be customized for your preferred media player, cloud provider, and media automation (*existing subscriptions unaffected*).

In order of increasing awesomeness, and now with nice and easy-to-remember URLs, these are:

1. [Zurglings](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/zurgling) (*contended, no automation*)
2. [Starters](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/starter) (*contended*)
3. [Hobbits](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/hobbit) (*semi-dedicated*)
4. [Rangers](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/ranger) (*semi-dedicated*)
5. [Halflings](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/halfling) (*semi-dedicated*)
6. [Nazguls](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/nazgul) (*dedicated*)

All bundles come with your choice of [Plex][plex] (*PlexPass required*), [Emby][emby], or [Jellyfin][jellyfin], can be managed (*except Zurglings*) by either [Riven][riven], [SeerrBridge][seerrbridge], [plex_debrid][plex-debrid], [cli_debrid][cli-debrid], or [Radarr][radarr]/[Sonarr][sonarr]/[Prowlarr][prowlarr], and support RealDebrid, AllDebrid (*VPN required*), Premiumize and EasyNews (*app-dependent*).

### Mooar Apps

#### List-Sync

[List-Sync][list-sync] "feeds" your [OverSeerr][overseerr] / [JellySeerr][jellyseerr] with content from Trakt, IMDB, or Letterboxd lists, allowing you to sync your libraries with your own (*or other public*) lists.

#### Letterboxd Trakt Sync (beta)

This one was added in response to a request from an Elfie - Need to sync your Letterboxd "diary" with your Trakt account? There's an [app for that](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/letterboxd-trakt-sync/)!

#### Profilarr (beta)

A long-time [EEP](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues/32), [Profilar](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/profilarr/) is a UI-based tool to manage quality profiles in the Aars. 

Initial testing by @Layezee20 has been very positive, and if you're an early adopter who's interested in fine-tuning your Aar quality profiles, this may bring you hours of delight!

No documentation yet, but it's follow-your-nose easy, with a subscription available [here](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/profilarr/).
  
#### AudioBookBayAutomated (beta)

[AudioBookBay Automated](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/audiobookbay-automated/) is another [bleeding-edge](https://github.com/JamesRy96/audiobookbay-automated) app which needs testing, but if you're an audiobook-phile, it may tweak your interest...

## Coming up

### US East Coast DC

It turns out that part of the delay in establishing our PA site has been related to the hardware supplier of the equivalent configurations we're using in the west-coast site, (elfhosted.cc). After some back-and-forth with our friends at Crunchbits, we've decided to pivot, and invest more heavily in the PA site, owning our own hardware outright, and scaling up capacity by 200-300%.

The appropriate :fire: has been lit, and we're getting high-priority, VIP treatment with a mind to establish the PA site by the end of May! :fingers_crossed:

### Symlink Cleaner

Our very own ElfVenger, @BSM, has been working on a new, Elf-sclusive app, cleverly named "Symlink Cleaner" (*he took a break during much of April for IRL responsibilities!*) Symlink Cleaner is currently available free as an [early-access trial](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/symlink-cleaner-early-access/), after which time we intend to roll it out to all Elfies, free of charge.

![](/images/screenshots/symlink-cleaner.png)

### Even mooar apps

Apps currently requested can be found (and submitted!) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Notable suggestions:

* [TitleCardMaker](https://titlecardmaker.com/) (*CLI version for now*)
