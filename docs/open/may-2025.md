# "ElfReport" for May 2025

During May, we continued to refine our most popular ElfStack (*the Aars*), reinforced our Discord anti-spam protection, and expanded our portfolio of Elf-illiated apps / devs.

To get us started, here are some geeky stats for May 2025, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/)...

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    The stats below illustrate CPU cores used (*not percentage*). These stats only cover the DE cluster at present, we're working on cross-cluster metrics aggregation to make this data more useful.

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire (DE) cluster.

    Other high consumers of RAM:

    * **csi-rclone**: used for mounting all rclone-compatible storage mounts, primarily RealDebrid libraries
    * **kube-system**: the Kubernetes control plane, including the cilium agents which manage the networking / policy enforcement (*currently 11K flows/s across 30 nodes*)
    * **traefik**: all inbound access to the cluster / services
    * **[mediafusion][mediafusion]**: an excellent (*but RAM-hungry!*) [Stremio addon](/stremio-addons/)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    Network usage during the snapshot period has is indicated below, but given the changing nature of traffic patterns across the day / week, it's not possible to reach any conclusions about the changes from month-to-month. Rather, the graphs below indicate that our nodes are not contending for network throughput, and our per-tier egress rate-limits are being correctly enforced.
    
    !!! tip "Why Hansel & Gretel?"
        Bundles are datacenter-agnostic, but nodes are specific to each datacenter, and we needed a way to differentiate US nodes from DE nodes. The fairy tale of [Hansel and Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel) originates in Germany :flag_de:

## Retrospective

### Spam attacks defeated

On Mother's Day (*while the ElfVengers and I were distracted*), a juvenile, attention-seeking, malicious user jumped into Discord and spammed all of our channels with a range of hateful, explicit, and disturbing content. This took longer than usual to clean up because the user immediately quit the server, making it harder to ban-and-wipe them.

To minimize the likelihood of a recurrence of this issue, we've tightened up access to Discord as follows:

1. 2FA is now required in order to send messages (*a Discord safety feature*)
2. Verification is required for new members to access the majority of community channels
3. Trusted volunteers are granted temporary moderation (*kick / banning*) powers in the event that an incident occurs and staff are unavailable
4. The Discord members list is routinely purged of inactive accounts (*this is why the membership count dropped this month*) [^1]

### Deprecation of Blackhole / RDTClient

Since Decypharr supports a "closed-loop" interaction with RealDebrid, it's now the clear best option as a downloader for the Aarr stacks. We [announced](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/05/27/rdtclient-and-blackhole-deprecated-use-decypharr/) the "gentle deprecation" of RDTClient / Blackhole for these stacks, which will roll out across June 2025 as stacks are renewed.

User can still manually opt-into RDTClient / Blackhole if they need them for a particular feature, but these won't be bundled with our Aar stacks by default anymore.

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/05/27/rdtclient-and-blackhole-deprecated-use-decypharr/)

### Mooar Apps

#### Storyteller

[Storyteller][storyteller] is a platform for automatically aligning ebooks and audiobooks for immersive reading, with native [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.smoores.Storyteller) / [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/storyteller-reader/id6474467720) apps.

Switch back and forth between listening and reading without losing your place, or have Storyteller read aloud to you while highlighting the text!

#### Booklore

[BookLore][booklore] is a web app for hosting, managing, and exploring books, with support for PDFs, eBooks, reading progress, metadata, and stats.

![Screenshot of Booklore](/images/screenshots/booklore.gif){ loading=lazy }

#### Wizzar

[Wizarr][wizarr] is an automatic user invitation system for Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby.
Create a unique invite link and share it with users — they’ll be automatically added to your media server and guided through downloading apps, accessing request systems, and more!

![Screenshot of Wizarr](/images/screenshots/wizarr.png){ loading=lazy }

**The problem**: Inviting your Friends/Family to your Plex server Is complicated and tedious. It's also a hard concept for them to get their head around.

**The solution**: Wizarr makes it easy to invite users to your server by simply sending them a link, and guides them through the process of getting set up.

Wizarr is still a little rough-around-the-edges, and is currently bundled with all ElfHosted Plex stacks by default.

## Coming up

### Zurgling 2.0

Hot-off-the-press, the [latest Zurg/DMM Patreon update](https://www.patreon.com/posts/stability-and-130991643) indicates:

> What's Coming
> 
> DMM Integration
> 
> Subscribe to content on DMM website
> 
> Subscribed content automatically added to your Zurg server
> 
> Similar to how Sonarr/Radarr monitor and grab releases

We're excited about this because it would be a significant quality-of-life improvement for [Zurgling](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/zurgling/) users, retaining the intended simplicity of their stacks, but automating away some of the human "clickops" required to add new content to their libraries.

### US East Coast DC

I'm told that our new hardware for the East Coast DC was shipped to site last week (*i.e., early June*). Unless something **else** goes wrong (:fingers_crossed:), we'll be building out `elfhosted.party` (*PA*) during June 2025, so that it's ready for our 2nd birthday in July 2025 (*below*) :cake: !

### Birthday treats :cake:

Next month (*July 2025*) is our second birthday! (*To see how far we've come, check out our [2023](/open/july-2023/) and [2024](/open/jul-2024/) reports*).

All going well, we hope to:

* Have our US DC ready for users to migrate to
* Announce a new loyalty program (*ElfPoints*) which we're currently trialing
* Announce a new sponsored community resource

Stay tuned!

### Even mooar apps

Apps currently requested can be found (and submitted!) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Notable suggestions:

* [TitleCardMaker](https://titlecardmaker.com/) (*CLI version for now*)

#### PeerTube

PeerTube is an open-source, federate-able video hosting platform. We use it for https://video.elfhosted.com, and we have a few in-flight requests for hosted instances. We're still working the bugs out of this one, but effectively a hosted PeerTube would get you your "own" YouTube, with content stored in your own external (S3-compatible) cloud storage.

#### Dispatcharr

[Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) is described as:

> ..an open-source powerhouse for managing IPTV streams and EPG data with elegance and control.
Born from necessity and built with passion

Or..

> Think of Dispatcharr as the *arr family’s IPTV cousin — simple, smart, and designed for streamers who want reliability and flexibility.

We're still at the proof-of-concept stage, and we've not had much success with Plex/Jellyfin/Emby-integrated IPTV (*[ChannelsDVR][channelsdvr] works great though!*), but if you're interested in helping to beta-test, then shout out!

#### Nuvio Streams

[Nuvio Streams](https://github.com/tapframe/NuvioStreamsAddon) is a new Stremio Addon, which scrapes HTTP streaming sites, and is especially interesting for non-english Stremio users. We've donated hosting resources to a public instance at https://nuviostreams.hayd.uk, and private instances will be available from June 2025.

### Your ideas?

Got ideas for improvements? Send us an EEP (*ElfHosted Enhancement Proposal*) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues/new/choose)!

## How to help

Another effective way to help is to drive traffic / organic discovery, by mentioning ElfHosted in appropriate forums such as Reddit's [r/plex](https://reddit.com/r/plex),  [r/realdebrid](https://reddit.com/r/realdebrid), and [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons), which is where much of our target audience is to be found!
