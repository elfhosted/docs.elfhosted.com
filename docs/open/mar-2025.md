# "ElfReport" for Mar 2025

During March, we improved our cloud provider coverage by massively improving support for Premiumize and EasyNews (*with Debridav*), diversified our downloaders by adding a 3rd download-symlink tool, and added a few more apps to the catalogue.

To get us started, here are some geeky stats for Mar 2025, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/)...

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    The stats below illustrate CPU cores used (*not percentage*). These stats only cover the DE cluster at present, we're working on cross-cluster metrics aggregation to make this data more useful.

    Tenant CPU load on average is 20% higher than the preceding period (*again*), with the rest of the supporting infrastructure's CPU usage remaining relatively static.

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire (DE) cluster. One mildly interesting observation is that Feb's snapshot was taken when we were running Traefik v2, and during Mar we upgrade to to Traefik v3, and optimized our configs, such that overall RAM usage by Traefik is significantly lower.

    Other high consumers of RAM:

    * **csi-rclone**: used for mounting all rclone-compatible storage mounts, primarily RealDebrid libraries
    * **kube-system**: the Kubernetes control plane, including the cilium agents which manage the networking / policy enforcement (*currently 11K flows/s across 30 nodes*)
    * **traefik**: all inbound access to the cluster / services
    * **[mediafusion][mediafusion]**: an excellent (*but RAM-hungry!*) [Stremio addon](/stremio-addons/)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    Network usage remains at about 20% of capacity on average, but (*due to thee changing nature of user behaviour*) this month there are more periods during which the effect of our egress rate-limiting can be clearly observed.
    
    !!! tip "Why Hansel & Gretel?"
        Bundles are datacenter-agnostic, but nodes are specific to each datacenter, and we needed a way to differentiate US nodes from DE nodes. The fairy tale of [Hansel and Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel) originates in Germany :flag_de:

## Retrospective

March saw us build out EasyNews and Premiumize support with Debridav (*below*), add a UI-based symlink downloader ([Decypharr][decypharr]), add two separate tools to add media requests via the Plex UI ([Pulsarr][pulsarr] and [Plex-Requests][plex-requests]), and dabble in some audiobook-adjacent apps ([AudioBookRequest][audiobookrequest]).

### Debridav Design

[Debridav][debridav] is a clever tool which is both a WebDAV server, a qBittorrent API, and an SABnzbd API. It's used to allow the creation of "libraries" using Premiumze or EasyNews. Until recently, the implementation was fiddly, since the media would have to be located in the Debridav WebDAV mount, which made it cumbersome to use alongside existing debrid providers like RealDebrid. 

Following some updates to both Debridav and our Aarr import script, it's now possible to seamlessly "bolt on" Premiumize or EasyNews (*or both!*) to your existing RealDebrid-integrated stack.

#### Premiumize

The clever feature that Debridav allows with Premiumize is "unlimited" library-building. Behind the scenes, the content you add isn't actually added to your Premiumize "cloud storage" (*limited to 1TB*) at all, but rather a virtual filesystem is built up from checking cached torrent links against Premiumize, and your "Fair Use Points" are only consumed when you actually **stream** the media referenced by the library.

Here's an example of a from-scratch Premiumize setup:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAMb-L9lTm4?si=W9H4UDEpwTzj6MFi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

!!! tip "Free 14 day trial vouchers available"
    We've negotiated free 14-day trial vouchers for Elfies (*only for new Premiumize accounts*) to try out the Premiumize integration - if you're interested, create an [#elf-help][elf-help] ticket and we'll hook you up!

#### EasyNews

EasyNews doesn't have an API to confirm whether a particular hash is cached, but it has a powerful search interface. Leveraging that search, and some internal development on a fake NewzNab indexer (*"fakearr"*), Prowlarr can search EasyNews for matching content, and then hand these over to Debridav to stream from EasyNews, building a virtual "library" much like the Premiumize design described above.

Here's an example of a from-scratch EasyNews setup:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkKQB61TL6I?si=WqNLHKekOUkcOLY8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

!!! tip "Get cheap EasyNews"
    To use EasyNews, you'll need an EasyNews account. You can get one for [as little as $2/month for the first year](https://signup.easynews.com/checkout/winback-deal-ae/).

### Mooar apps

The following apps made their debut on ElfHosted during Feb 2025:

#### Decypharr

[Decypharr][decypharr] is yet-another debrid downloader-but-not-really-a-downloader-it-actually-creates-symlinks, but with multi-debrid support, and a UI!

![Screenshot of Decypharr](/images/screenshots/decypharr.png){ loading=lazy }

We ran a 7-day trial of Decypharr, following which we rolled it out as an option to all Aarr users, and made it the default for fresh installs.

#### Plex Requests

Plex Requests in a collection of several clever "microservices" which "abuse" the Plex API to make it possible to add requests to Overseerr, directly from Plex apps.

![Screenshot of Plex Requests](/images/screenshots/plex-requests.gif){ loading=lazy }

The Plex ecosystem is a little rocky ATM, with the (*rushed?*) rollout of the "new" mobile apps, and it's likely that there will be further development effort required before Plex Requests will work with these new apps.

A simpler-but-as-effective solution is to use Plex watchlists to trigger additions to your ElfStack, using ... Pulsarr (*below*)

#### Pulsarr

[Pulsarr][pulsarr] is an integration tool that bridges Plex watchlists with [Sonarr][sonarr] and [Radarr][radarr], enabling real-time media monitoring and automated content acquisition all from within the Plex App itself.

![Screenshot of Pulsarr](/images/screenshots/pulsarr.png){ loading=lazy }

Enjoy all the benefits of other content discovery systems without requiring users to use additional services. All the magic happens from the primary users Plex Token.

It provides user-based watchlist synchronization for yourself and for friends, smart content routing based on genre, and notification capabilities.

#### AudioBookRequest

A bleeding-edge new addition, [AudioBookRequest][audiobookrequest] leverages Prowlarr (*and whatever downloader it's configured with*) to download audiobooks based on a watchlist you maintain, with the help of a searchable index from Audible.

![Screenshot of AudioBook Request](/images/screenshots/audiobookrequest.png){ loading=lazy }

With the addition of [Decypharr][decypharr] (*which offers a generic qBittorent-like API to the Aars*), AudioBookRequest can use [Prowlarr][prowlarr] to search for and download books from your "watchlist", storing a symlink in `/storage/symlinks/downloads/prowlarr`, which you can then (for now) manually move to a folder under `/storage/symlinks` to be managed using [AudioBookshelf][audiobookshelf].

## Coming up

### Plex remote streaming restrictions

Plex [announced significant changes](https://www.plex.tv/blog/important-2025-plex-updates/) to remote streaming from 29 April 2025. In effect, unless you're a Plex Pass subscriber, or you purchase a "Remote Watch Pass" subscription from Plex, you will no longer be able to stream your media "remotely" (*outside of the location where your Plex server is running*). While we're not sure yet exactly what the implications will be for our non-PlexPass users, the takeaway understood currently is this:

1. If you're a PlexPass user, nothing changes. Go back to bed :bed:
2. If you're **not** a PlexPass user but you **are** committed to the Plex ecosystem, you'd be advised to grab a lifetime [PlexPass membership](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) during April, after which the price is set to more-than-double from USD $120 to $250.
3. If you're fed up with Plex and this is the last straw, you could consider your options by adding a [standalone Jellyfin](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/jellyfin-standalone/) or [standalone Emby](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/emby/) to your stack, evaluating them for the 7-day trial period, and then "switching" your stack to the Jellyfin/Emby equivalent once you've tested in parallel to your existing Plex setup. 
   At least that way you'll be well-informed when the hammer drops, and you discover that you've either got to pay Plex to continue streaming, or jump ship!

### US East Coast DC

The extremely handsome and intelligent Crunchbits chief-cable-monkey :monkey: Eric has confirmed that our US East Coast infrastructure is being deployed during the month of April. Quoting Eric:

> ElfHosted and their devishly charming leader @funkypenguin, are without a doubt our number-one priority for the entire PA datacenter build, and I will personally be working night and day to ensure that the East Coast Elfies get to enjoy the enhanced streaming speeds which await them upon completion of the PA rack build - 1 April 2025

### Symlink Cleaner

Our very own ElfVenger, @BSM, has been working on a new, Elf-sclusive app, cleverly named "Symlink Cleaner". Symlink Cleaner is currently available free as an [early-access trial](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/symlink-cleaner-early-access/), after which time we intend to roll it out to all Elfies, free of charge.

![](/images/screenshots/symlink-cleaner.png)

### AudioBookBayAutomated

[AudioBookBay Automated](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/audiobookbay-automated/) is another [bleeding-edge](https://github.com/JamesRy96/audiobookbay-automated) app which needs testing during March, but if you're an audiobook-phile, it may tweak your interest...

![](/images/screenshots/audiobookbayautomated.png)

### Even mooar apps

Apps currently requested can be found (and submitted!) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Notable suggestions:

* [TitleCardMaker](https://titlecardmaker.com/) (*CLI version for now*)
* [Profilarr](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues/32): A UI-based tool to manage quality profiles in the Aaars

### ElfGuides (ongoing)

We've made videos about how to drive our most popular setups, but given the tools and apps change so fast, the videos very often become out-of-date. Re-recording a video simply to address a change a single tool in a larger workflow can be tedious and time-consuming, so we've been exploring another option.

The "ElfGuides" are a collection of ScribeHow documents, assembled modularly from a collection of "Scribes" (*screenshot-driven guides*), which can be mix/matched up to provide a detailed guide per-stack (*there are more than 30 variations now*!). When a tool in the stack changes, updating the guides is just a matter of updating the individual "module" covering that tool.

If you've been a long-time Elfie, you'll not have seen any guides, but they're emailed to new subscribers as they start their subscription!

The most popular app stacks are covered in the ElfGuides currently, but given the variety / rate of change we face, the effort to maintain these is... ongoing.
