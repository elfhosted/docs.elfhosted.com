# "Elf-Disclosure" for Aug 2024

August was our first month on the latest pricing, without free trials or free ElfBuckz.

While expenses remained roughly the same, the most obvious change from previous months is.. we covered our cash expenses! :partying_face:

I'd like to say that it's the result of the [pricing model update](#pricing-changes), but I'd caution that it's quite likely that this month's big numbers are an anomaly, for the following reasons:

1. We changed the way the revenue is reported. This months' stats are from the Woocommerce Analytics's "*Revenue*" report, whereas previous months were calculated based on the older, WooCommerce Reports's "*Deposits*" report. 

We weren't able to use the Revenue report in previous months because free ElfBuckz / trials skewed the data, but in hindsight, the "deposits" report was probably not doing what we thought, and reporting **only** ElfBuckz deposits (*rather than all payments, which I expected*).

2. Many users took advantage of prepaid periods when switching over to the new monthly subscription models in August, so it's likely that this revenue represents several months of service, pre-paid, and subsequent months will be missing these values.

To get us started, here are some shiny stats for Aug 2024, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](/blog/)...

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    The stats below illustrate CPU cores used (*not percentage*). The July 2024 screenshots below were taken after the subscription pricing/updates, which caused us to shed ~50% of original/daily subscribers, and with the increase in users, and the "spreading out" of apps across more hobbits/rangers (*giving them "room to run"*), it's interesting (*and a little surprising!*) to see tenant CPU usage increase by over 100%! :scream_cat:
    
    Examination of the `kubectl top nodes` output shows how we've reduced the contented nodes (*elves*), in favor of more users opting for semi-dedicated nodes (*rangers and hobbits*)

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire cluster. Tenant memory usage has increased from last month along with tenant CPU usage (*although not as dramatically!*)

    Other high consumers of RAM:

    * **rook-ceph**: uses RAM for caching on its network-storage-related workloads
    * **csi-rclone**: used for mounting all rclone-compatible storage mounts, primarily RealDebrid libraries
    * **kube-system**: the Kubernetes control plane, including the cilium agents which manage the networking / policy enforcement (*currently 11K flows/s across 30 nodes*)
    * **traefik**: all inbound access to the cluster / services
    * **kube-prometheus-stack**: our relatively un-optimized observability stack
    * **[mediafusion][mediafusion]**: an excellent (*but RAM-hungry!*) [Stremio addon](/stremio-addons/)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    Now that the majority of customer workloads are on the hobbits/rangers, the elves are seeing a generally low usage pattern:

    ![Network traffic for Aug 2024 (*elves*)](/images/reports/2024-08/cluster-network-utilization-elves.png)

    The 10Ge ceph nodes (goblins) occasionally peak over 1Ge during backups / intensive library activity:

    ![Network traffic for Aug 2024 (*goblins*)](/images/reports/2024-08/cluster-network-utilization-goblins.png)

    And the semi-dedicated nodes (*rangers and hobbits*) are seeing increased usage - it's interesting to note the effects of the rate limits on these nodes, as regular "block-shaped" sections of the usage graph:

## Retrospective

### US Cluster trial / progress

While waiting for the dust to settle on the repricing / monthly subscriptions changes, we progressed the US cluster design, to the point that we've had several "live" users on it for weeks now.

The final cluster is being assembled by the datacenter (*they're busy with it right now*), which will give us a minimum viable starter of 1 fairy (*control plane*), 1 hobbit (*1/8th dedicated*), 1 ranger (*1/4th dedicated*), and 1 elf (*contended workloads*). The final cluster is running different hardware to the trial cluster (*E3-1270v5 "micro-clouds" with Intel Quicksync support for transcoding*), so we'll need another testing period before making them generally available.

If you'd like to gauge whether the US cluster would be more suitable for your workloads, visit https://speed.elfhosted.com and perform some comparative tests!

### Feedback results

In order to discover what we need to improve, we did our first round of "feedback" during Aug, using a new (*to us*) open-source form tool, [FormBricks](https://feedback.elfhosted.com).

92 users responded, and 57 of those completed the survey. The results were both enlightening and sobering.

Here are a few facts we discovered:

* The majority (66%) of our users found us via Reddit
* The primary feedback on what could be improved was the UX of the docs and the store.
* App requests include Doplarr (*manage media requests via Discord*), Wizarr (*manage invites*), and Immich (*Google Photos alternative*).
* The recent pricing changes drove some long-term users away, but in general users believe the pricing to be fair and value for money.
* Most popular requests were better bandwidth/latency (*for streaming performance*), and more reliability of tools like Riven
* Our net-promoter-score was basically neutral (*below*)

![Net Promoter score for Aug 2024](/images/reports/2024-08/net-promoter-score.png)

While I tried to follow up on all the feedback individually, in some cases I wasn't able to because I neglected to capture contact details in the (*anonymous*) survey :man_facepalming: If you've got feedback, and I haven't contacted you to discuss, please feel free to [reach out](https://discord.elfhosted.com)!

Here are a few questions / answers hand-picked from feedback:

#### Why are even simple CNAMEs or storage mounts priced at $9/month in the store?

1. Because messing them up can wreck your entire stack, and you'd have an expectation of support from our team, and we're not doing that for free.
2. Because when app prices are the same, you can easily "switch between" apps at zero cost. So you can switch out a CNAME for another app to trial for a few days, and then switch it out again for a third. You can also "upgrade" to more expensive apps, and the store will pro-rate the difference.

#### Can I run ElfHosted on my own hardware?

No, because (1) our clusters include secrets (*extractable with root access*) for things like our S3 buckets, CloudFlare logins, etc, and (2) we deliberately provision extra hardware such that in the event of a node failure, we have enough capacity to run 100% of customer workloads on the remaining nodes. To replicate this with your own hardware, such that our support overheads would be minimized, you'd need 2 nodes, minimum.

#### Isn't $9/month a little high for some of these apps?

ElfHosted's "killer feature" is our community support, which is driven by volunteers and staff (*and a slightly whacky AI bot*), all of which consume resources (*time, money, personal attention*).

Your $9/month (*equivalant to 2 regular cups of coffee or one craft beer in NZ*) covers not just the infrastructure costs to run each app, but also the time, attention, and goodwill of the support team keeping the lights on! :beer: :coffee: :heart:

## Coming up

### No-Piracy Policy

We skirt a fine line, between providing users with self-hosted apps, under their own control, and being seen as assisting with copyright infringement. While we don't want to detract from our [5-star support reputation](/testimonials/), the ElfVengers and I are going to start being more circumspect in a few areas...

#### No more staff access to your apps

We no longer have the tools / privileges to directly access your apps. This means our staff **cannot** know how you have them configured, **cannot** see what you're doing with them, and **cannot** effect changes to your apps, other than resetting them to defaults.

While this may make it more difficult for us to "nudge" you to the correct config, it's important to maintain our position as a neutral infrastructure provider. Where we've been relying on "*quickly fixing it for you*" if something breaks, we'll have to do a better job of documenting or setting global defaults.

#### Sensitive data to be redacted

As has always been the case (*but we've been lax in enforcing*), we can't share unredacted screenshots / texts in our Discord which include any infringing content. We will start actively deleting these when they occur.

We understand that this may frustrate debugging / support efforts, and may require something of a culture shift. We want to maintain our sterling support reputation, but not at the cost of liability, so any support in our official channels has to remain within reasonable legal bounds. We therefore ask you to be discreet in your support requests, to avoid us having to redact :pray:

!!! tip
    There are other avenues for more "open" discussion of piracy, unaffiliated with / unendorsed by ElfHosted, such as (*recently*) Hayduk's House of HOWTOs (*I convinced them to add an ElfHosted support section!*) ([Discord](https://discord.gg/cQ2V9vRb) / [Website](https://hayd.uk)), and of course, [r/Piracy](https://reddit.com/r/piracy).

### Store improvements

As is obviously necessary from recent feedback, I'll be paying some attention to the store layout / organization this month. The mobile experience is kinda poor, and (*like most things built by us geeks*), you only know where to find stuff if you already know where to find stuff.

I'll be trialing a new theme, and improved email / communication options.

### More apps

The following new apps are either ready for testing (*undocumented*), or on the list for this month:

#### Doplarr

[Doplarr](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/doplarr) is in and working, just not documented yet. We have at least one user happily using it, but it may end up being dethroned by...

#### Requestrr

[Requestrr](https://github.com/thomst08/requestrr) is a chatbot used to simplify using services like Sonarr/Radarr/Overseerr/Ombi via the use of chat!

Features:

* Ability to request content via Discord using slash commands, buttons and more!
* Users can get notified when their requests complete
* Sonarr (V2-V4) & Radarr (V2-V5) integration with support for multiple instance via Overseerr (only for 4k/1080p)
* Overseerr integration with support for per user permissions/quotas and issue submission
* Ombi (V3/V4) integration with support for per user roles/quotas and issue submission
* Fully configurable via a web portal

#### Threadfin

[Threadfin](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/threadfin) is a better-but-still-PITA fork of Xteve, letting you bring your IPTV into Plex. It sort-of works, depending on your provider. Again, not documented yet, and YMMV, but you can exercise your 14d refund if it doesn't work out for you!

#### Immich

[Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich) is a self-hosted replacement for Google Photos. To use it with ElfHosted, you'd need to have attached storage. Development is underway :)

#### West's Blackhole Script

[West's scripts](https://github.com/westsurname/scripts) include a "blackhole" shell script, which replaces the functions of RDTClient. It's dethroned RDTClient in <https://savvyguides.wiki>, and while some of its functions are redundant to us (*Plex requests, etc*), having an alternative to RDTCLient seems sensible. Especially one which can use to integrate the Aars with Torbox...

### Torbox Teamup

Wamy from [Torbox](https://torbox.app/) is keen to team up with us on a product bundle / offering to support ElfHosted Torbox users. We're ironing out the details this month, but rather than trying to use Torbox to replace RD for gigantic-library-building, possible applications are:

1. Using your private trackers with the Aars for "infinite streaming Plex", while continuing to seed back and maintain your ratio.
2. Adding a "backup" debrid service for your most critical / popular content, so that you have a fallback in the event of RD rate-limits / changes.
3. Sourcing non-torrent, premium quality from Torbox's usenet sources.

Stay [tuned](/blog/) for details!

### Your ideas?
