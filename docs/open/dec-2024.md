# "ElfReport" for Dec 2024

Following the increased effort in November to prepare for Black Friday, December was a quiet, internally-focused month, primarily about preparing for a holiday break, ensuring enough bugs were fixed and capacity was added to carry us over into January without having to make any significant (*and disruptive*) changes.

During December, it became apparent that our open-source, build-in-public business metrics had inspired [less-than-transparent competitors](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1h1tybl/elfhosted_withdraws_easydebrid_paradisecloud/), and consequently we've decided to stop disclosing financial metrics in our monthly reports. (*our technical resources remain [open-source](/open/)*)

To get us started, here are some geeky stats for Dec 2024, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/)...

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    The stats below illustrate CPU cores used (*not percentage*). These stats only cover the DE cluster at present, we're working on cross-cluster metrics aggregation to make this data more useful.

    Tenant CPU load is 25% higher than the previous month, and while MediaFusion has seen a decrease in load due to database query optimizations, Comet has seen an **increase**, since the StremThru implementation restored RD cached searches several days ago.

    Note that leading up to Black Friday, we significantly increased our compute capacity (*compare the amount of nodes this month to last month*), and during December we scaled these back to realistic requirements.

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire (DE) cluster. Tenant memory usage increased 10% from the previous month, and apps which run on daemonsets (*i.e., a pod on every node*) showed a decrease, since excessive nodes added for Black Friday were trimmed away.

    Other high consumers of RAM:

    * **csi-rclone**: used for mounting all rclone-compatible storage mounts, primarily RealDebrid libraries
    * **kube-system**: the Kubernetes control plane, including the cilium agents which manage the networking / policy enforcement (*currently 11K flows/s across 30 nodes*)
    * **traefik**: all inbound access to the cluster / services
    * **[mediafusion][mediafusion]**: an excellent (*but RAM-hungry!*) [Stremio addon](/stremio-addons/)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    Last month's spikes on the contended nodes (*hansels*) turned out to be related to in-cluster backups, rather than tenant-driven load, and this misconfiguration was resolved. Hansel and Gretel traffic patterns are now more aligned to what you'd expect, comparing December to November:
    
    !!! tip "Why Hansel & Gretel?"
        Bundles are datacenter-agnostic, but nodes are specific to each datacenter, and we needed a way to differentiate US nodes from DE nodes. The fairy tale of [Hansel and Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel) originates in Germany :flag_de:

## Retrospective

December was an intentionally quiet month with respect to changes, with the only notable changes occurring **after** the Christmas break.

### Mooar apps

The following apps made their debut on ElfHosted during December 2024:

#### Flixio

Flixio is a patched instance of the official Stremio Web app, which keeps all of your watching history under your control. It also re-adds support for external players (*VLC, Infuse*), popular with mobile device users.

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/12/31/use-stremio-anonymously-with-flixio/)

#### StremThru

[StremThru][stremthru] is a debrid "multi-tool", capable of adding proxy-streaming or debrid support to any **other** Stremio Addon. The introduction of StremThru has also allowed us to patch the outstanding issue with Comet, which hasn't been able to serve RD/DL/AD links since the big API withdrawls in late Nov 2024.

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/12/30/stremthru-streams-through/)

### RIP gift cards and merch

We discovered that credit card scammers were abusing our store to purchase gift cards (*with different credit cards each time*), and then immediately using those gift cards to buy themselves clothing from our Merch category.

Rather than face down angry victims of credit card theft, or payment processor chargebacks, we've simply removed gift cards and merch from the store for now.

### Multi-debrid support

During December we progressed better coverage across multiple debrid platforms, including TorBox, AllDebrid, and Debrid-Link. There's still more to be done with Premiumize and CineSync, so look forward to more options in January 2025!

## Coming up

### Even mooar apps

Apps currently requested can be found (and submitted!) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Notable suggestions:

* [TitleCardMaker](https://titlecardmaker.com/) (*CLI version for now*)
* [CineSync](https://github.com/sureshfizzy/CineSync) - will tidy up the debrid-facing storage mounts used with Plex, for Zurglings (*and maybe offer "CineSynclings"?*)
* [DebriDav](https://github.com/skjaere/DebriDav) - will facilitate Aars working with Premiumizie

### Guide / blog refresh (ongoing)

While we've completed the migration of the blog from the docs site to the store, the refreshing of our guides is still on the short-term to-do list.

Now that we have a mostly-workable theme for the store, the ElfVengers and I will be moving much of the guides from the docs site (https://elfhosted.com) to the store, since this is more suitable for frequent, collaborative edits. We've also been experimenting with ScribeHow guides, which have been a popular alternative to our video guides (*modular, and much quicker to produce!*)

### Your ideas?

Got ideas for improvements? Send us an EEP (*ElfHosted Enhancement Proposal*) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues/new/choose)!

## How to help

Another effective way to help is to drive traffic / organic discovery, by mentioning ElfHosted in appropriate forums such as Reddit's [r/plex](https://reddit.com/r/plex),  [r/realdebrid](https://reddit.com/r/realdebrid), and [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons), which is where much of our target audience is to be found!
