# "ElfReport" for Sep 2024

September was a "*bed-in-and-bugfix*" month, with most of the attention going to the US datacenter trial, node refreshes, and new bundles.

I'm happy to announce that for the second month, we covered our cash expenses! :partying_face:

To get us started, here are some shiny stats for Sept 2024, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](/blog/)...

## Stats

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    The stats below illustrate CPU cores used (*not percentage*). These stats are incomplete this month, since ~20 users have migrated to the 3 US cluster nodes, neither of which are visible on this graph.
    
    Examination of the `kubectl top nodes` output reflects the transition from elves (*contended*), and hobbits / rangers (*dedicated*) to "hansels" (*contended*) and "gretels" (*dedicated*), as we've added additional bundle types (*halflings and nazguls*).

    !!! tip "Why Hansel & Gretel?"
        Bundles are datacenter-agnostic, but nodes are specific to each datacenter, and we needed a way to differentiate US nodes from DE nodes. The fairy tale of [Hansel and Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel) originates in Germany :flag_de:

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire (DE) cluster. Interestingly, tenant memory usage has is on par with last month, while CPU usage is significantly less. 

    Other high consumers of RAM:

    * **rook-ceph**: uses RAM for caching on its network-storage-related workloads
    * **csi-rclone**: used for mounting all rclone-compatible storage mounts, primarily RealDebrid libraries
    * **kube-system**: the Kubernetes control plane, including the cilium agents which manage the networking / policy enforcement (*currently 11K flows/s across 30 nodes*)
    * **traefik**: all inbound access to the cluster / services
    * **kube-prometheus-stack**: our relatively un-optimized observability stack
    * **[mediafusion][mediafusion]**: an excellent (*but RAM-hungry!*) [Stremio addon](/stremio-addons/)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    We perform daily backups of client volumes throughout the day, on the hour, in 24 evenly-distributed batches. As a result, we see spikes of ceph throughput on the hour:

    ![Network traffic for Sep 2024 (*goblins*)](/images/reports/2024-09/cluster-network-utilization-goblins.png)

    In general, the contended and dedicated nodes show slightly more traffic incoming vs outgoing (*video being transcoded, or streamed with buffering*), which is a big improvement over previous months where Plex/Aarr configurations showed huge amounts of ingress for relatively little egress, as symlinked video files were "analyzed" but not streamed!

## Retrospective

### US cluster

About 20 users have made the switch to the US cluster. We've been through a few weeks of "fine-tuning" for the resource constraints in the US (*less RAM/CPU, more bandwidth*), and with the Riven RAM database limits we've now applied, the platform has been stable for the past week or so.

Here's what the cluster looks like today (*compare this with the `kubectl top` output in the CPU/RAM sections above*):

```
root@eagle01:~# k top nodes
NAME       CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
eagle01    475m         5%     10632Mi         33%
yankee01   2327m        29%    20906Mi         65%
yankee02   867m         10%    21798Mi         68%
yankee03   1130m        14%    19992Mi         62%
root@eagle01:~#
```

Our biggest concern is the US cluster is now the lack of redundancy on the control-plane (*there's only one eagle node, currently*), and simply a lack of capacity to meet demand.

There's new hardware on back-order for the past 2 weeks, which I'm told will be available to us in the next week or so, bringing us to 3 eagles (*HA FTW!*), and doubling our workload capacity to 6 yankees.

If you'd like to gauge whether the US cluster would be more suitable for your workloads, visit https://speed.elfhosted.com and perform some comparative tests!

### New store theme and layout

As flagged in last month's report, the store has received a refresh, with a new theme and organizational structure. Apps are now sorted by type (*chat, backup, streaming*,.. ), and activity (*sharing, managing, watching..*), and Ideogram's 2.0 model has been brought to bear on our product images.

The checkout process is still clunky though, and adds more friction than we'd like. Turning on the "next-gen" block-based checkout gives us "express checkout" with Apple/Google Pay, but it breaks ElfBuckz, and the ability for users to pick their own username on checkout, so further refinement is required here!

### Tiered discounts

We've added the [Woocommerce Memberships Plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-memberships/), which allows us to now offer tiered pricing for bundled subscribers.

This tiered pricing allows us to offer cheaper supplemental apps to users who've already subscribed to a bundle, as follows:

Bundle | Discount | Simple App | Complex App
---------|----------|---------|---------
 - | - | $9/month | $18/month [^1]
 [Hobbit](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/hobbit) [1/8 dedicated] | 22% | $7/month | $14/month
 [Ranger](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/ranger) [1/4 dedicated] | 44% | $5/month | $10/month
 [Halfling](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/halfling) [1/2 dedicated] | 66% | $3/month | $6/month
 [Nazgul](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/nazgul) [all yours!] | 88% | $1/month | $2/month

If you've already added non-bundled apps (*custom domains, storage mounts, etc*) to your bundle, you'll need to cancel / re-subscribe these to to take advantage of the discounted pricing. Create an [#elf-help][elf-help] ticket if you need a hand with this!

More details in [this blog post](/blog/2024/09/18/tiered-discounts-for-bundles/).

### $1 Daily Bundles

In the Aug 2024 feedback, many of the responses to "how did you find us?" had to do with the initial free credit / trials we offered. While we can't get trials back (*they break billing and bundle-hopping*), we wanted to lower the "barrier to entry", so we now have 1-day expiring "demos", allowing prospective new users to "kick the tyres" for 24h, for just $1, once-off.

We have demos for every [Plex / Emby / Jellyfin combination](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/24h-demo/) with Riven or the Aars, and will be adding more options in future for Torbox, AllDebrid, Debridlink, etc.

### Nazgul / Halflings arrive

With the standardization of dedicated node types for DE ("Gretels"), we can now finally offer the larger-sized packages users have been asking for, and during September, we introduced [Halfling](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/halfling) (50% dedicated) and [Nazgul](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/nazgul/) (100% dedicated) bundles!

Of note, both Halflings and Nazguls can burst up to 1Gbps, but on Halflings that 1Gbps is fairly shared with any neighbors, whereas on a Nazgul, it's all yours!

More details in [this blog post](/blog/2024/09/23/introducing-hansel-and-gretel/)

### Mooar apps

Now that we've explained that bundled subscribers get discounts on extra apps, note that September also saw us add the following new apps:

#### Tunarr

[Tunarr](https://store.elfhosted.com/app/tunarr) - create live TV channels from media on your Plex servers, and more!

Configure your channels, programs, commercials, and settings using the Tunarr web UI.

Access your channels by adding the spoofed Tunarr HDHomerun tuner to Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby. Or utilize the m3u Url with any 3rd party IPTV player app.

#### Threadfin

[Threadfin](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/threadfin) is a better-but-still-PITA fork of Xteve, letting you bring your IPTV into Plex. It sort-of works, depending on your provider.

#### West's Blackhole Script

[West's scripts](https://github.com/westsurname/scripts) include a "blackhole" shell script, which replaces the functions of RDTClient. It's dethroned RDTClient in <https://savvyguides.wiki>, and while some of its functions are redundant to us (*Plex requests, etc*), having an alternative to RDTCLient seems sensible. Especially one which can use to integrate the Aars with Torbox.

!!! tip "Blackhole is included in all bundles"
    You don't have to do anything to get blackhole - it's included in all Hobbit / Ranger / Halfling / Nazgul bundles!

#### Petio

[Petio](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/petio) is a third party companion app available to Plex server owners to allow their users to request, review and discover content. The app is built to appear instantly familiar and intuitive to even the most tech-agnostic users.

Petio will help you manage requests from your users, connect to other third party apps such as Sonarr and Radarr, notify users when content is available and track request progress. Petio also allows users to discover media both on and off your server, quickly and easily find related content and review to leave their opinion for other users.

Petio is an ongoing, forever free, always evolving project currently in alpha prototype stage and now available!

#### Requestrr

[Requestrr](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/requestrr) is a chatbot used to simplify using services like Sonarr/Radarr/Overseerr/Ombi via the use of chat!

Features:

* Ability to request content via Discord using slash commands, buttons and more!
* Users can get notified when their requests complete
* Sonarr (V2-V4) & Radarr (V2-V5) integration with support for multiple instance via Overseerr (only for 4k/1080p)
* Overseerr integration with support for per user permissions/quotas and issue submission
* Ombi (V3/V4) integration with support for per user roles/quotas and issue submission
* Fully configurable via a web portal

#### Doplarr

[Doplarr](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/doplarr) is a CLI tool to provide a Discord-based interface to a Radarr / Sonarr instance. You can use it, for example, to allow Discord users to make requests, without providing direct access to Radarr / Sonarr.

#### Immich

[Immich](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/immich) is a self-hosted replacement for Google Photos. Detailed instructions and video guides are available [here][immich].

#### Pairdrop

[Pairdrop](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/pairdrop) provides local file sharing in your web browser.

* Inspired by Apple’s AirDrop.
* Fork of Snapdrop

**Features**

File sharing on your local network that works on all platforms.

* A multi-platform AirDrop-like solution that works.
    * Send images, documents or text via peer-to-peer connection to devices on the same local network.
* Internet transfers
    * Join temporary public rooms to transfer files easily over the Internet.
* Web-app
    * Works on all devices with a modern web-browser.

#### MediaFlow Proxy

[MediaFlow Proxy](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/mediaflow-proxy/) can be combined with public / ElfHosted [MediaFusion](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/mediafusion/) to allow users to simultaneously stream from RealDebrid with Stremio/Kodi, from multiple devices on multiple networks, without a RD account ban (*like Comet's [ProxyStreaming](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/comet-proxy-streaming-addon/) feature*).

## Coming up

### Even mooar apps

Apps currently requested can be found (and submitted!) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Notable coming-soons:

* Kometa's "ImageMaid"
* [TitleCardMaker](https://titlecardmaker.com/) (*CLI version for now*)

### Guide / blog refresh

Now that we have a mostly-workable theme for the store, the ElfVengers and I will be moving much of the guides from the docs site (https://elfhosted.com) to the store, since this is more suitable for frequent, collaborative edits.

We'll also be moving the [ElfHosted blog](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/) to the store, for better integration into our products, member-only content (*provided by the new membership plugin!*), and automated emailing of new blog posts (*you'll have seen a few of these recently*). 

We're not sure yet exactly where the division should be, but the docs site should remain technical and price-agnostic, whereas the store should present what we offer, commercially, as simply and attractively as possible.

### US East Coast DC

Now that we have the US West Coast DC humming, we've started the process of building out an East Coast DC, in [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania). Please submit your suggestions for what the DNS suffix and node names should be!

### Torbox Teamup

Wamy from [Torbox](https://torbox.app/) is keen to team up with us on a product bundle / offering to support ElfHosted Torbox users. We're still ironing out the details, but rather than trying to use Torbox to replace RD for gigantic-library-building, possible applications are:

1. Using your private trackers with the Aars for "infinite streaming Plex", while continuing to seed back and maintain your ratio.
2. Adding a "backup" debrid service for your most critical / popular content, so that you have a fallback in the event of RD rate-limits / changes.
3. Sourcing non-torrent, premium quality from Torbox's usenet sources.

Stay [tuned](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/) for details!
