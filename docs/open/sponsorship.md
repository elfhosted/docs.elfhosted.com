# Paying it forward

ElfHosted's model is basically to be paid for providing the infrastructure, configuration, automation and maintenance necessary to successfully run popular open-source tools.

We believe in supporting the open-source devs whose work supports our ecosystem, and proudly support the following.

(*confirm our sponsorship [here](https://github.com/funkypenguin/), [here](https://github.com/orgs/elfhosted/sponsoring), and [here](https://opencollective.com/elfhosted)*)

We also have "Elf-illiated" arrangements with friendly devs, who received a contribution for every subscription to their apps.
