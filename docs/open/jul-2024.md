# "Elf-Disclosure" for July 2024

It's our (*production*) birthday! :birthday: 

ElfHosted has survived our first year, passing the following milestones:

* :receipt: > 100,000 orders in the store (*daily orders being a PITA, more on that later*)
* :simple-discord: > 1,200 Elves in Discord

As you'll see below, we're improving month-on-month on every positive metric, but we're not profitable or even breaking even on cash expenses yet. August 2024's [pricing model update](#pricing-changes), plus the deprecation of ElfStorage resources, will hopefully bring us closer!

For a look back at far we've come, here's the [July 2023 Elf-Disclosure](/open/july-2023/) report for comparison! (*those CPU/RAM graphs look so cute and tiny in comparison!*)

To get us started, here are some shiny stats for July 2024, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](/blog/)...

## Resources

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    The stats below illustrate CPU cores used (*not percentage*), and as expected, tenant workloads remain the highest consumer of CPU, followed by an ever-decreasing collection of internal services. The screenshots below were taken after the subscription pricing/updates, which caused us to shed ~50% of original/daily subscribers, so there's expected to be a bit of flux regarding resource usage this month.

    The "last" values on the chart are specific to when the snapshot was taken, but compared to the previous month, there's not a lot of change in overall tenant CPU usage (*which is good, most of the resource pressure is on network and storage I/O*). 
    
    Examination of the `kubectl top nodes` output shows the removal of ElfStorage / Ceph HDD nodes (the dwarves), and the rebalancing of dedicated resource reservations as users migrated from contented nodes (elves) to rangers and hobbits.

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire cluster. Tenant workloads are now the top consumer of RAM, with rook-ceph (*which needs RAM for caching*) demoted to second place, after the removal of ElfStorage.

    Other high consumers of RAM:

    * **csi-rclone**: used for mounting all rclone-compatible storage mounts, primarily RealDebrid libraries
    * **kube-system**: the Kubernetes control plane, including the cilium agents which manage the networking / policy enforcement (*currently 11K flows/s across 30 nodes*)
    * **traefik**: all inbound access to the cluster / services
    * **kube-prometheus-stack**: our relatively un-optimized observability stack
    * **[mediafusion][mediafusion]**: an excellent (*but RAM-hungry!*) [Stremio addon](/stremio-addons/)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    As more users migrated to semi-dedicated Hobbits/Rangers, and after the RealDebrid fair-use policy changes, and their rate-limit updates revealed some inefficiencies around how Zurg "repairs" content, it became obvious that dedicated 10Gbit nodes were no longer necessary, and the giants were decomissioned.

    The contended nodes (elves) have the most inconsistent load profiles (*as you'd expect*):

    ![Network traffic for Jul 2024 (*elves*)](/images/reports/2024-07/cluster-network-utilization-elves.png)

    The 10Ge ceph nodes (goblins) occasionally peak over 1Ge during backups / intensive library activity:

    ![Network traffic for Jul 2024 (*goblins*)](/images/reports/2024-07/cluster-network-utilization-goblins.png)

    And the semi-dedicated nodes (*rangers and hobbits*) are typically quiet in the week (*when this snapshot was taken*), other than an as-yet-unfixed issue causing library updates/analysis in some cases (*the Aars are the primary suspect, followed by Plex/Jellyfin..*)

## Retrospective

### Pricing changes :dollar:

The most obvious Jul/Aug change is our [pricing model](/open/pricing/), which underwent some flux during July, and has now settled for August.

With a mind to (a) become profitable, and (b) be simpler to understand, the previously-geeky-and-convoluted pricing calculation method was replaced with:

1. Simple apps: $9/month
2. Complex apps: $19/month
3. [Starter kits](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/consume-media/infinite-streaming/infinite-streaming-starter-kits): $29/month
4. [Hobbit bundles](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/consume-media/infinite-streaming/hobbit): $39/month
5. [Ranger bundles](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/consume-media/infinite-streaming/infinite-streaming-plus): $59/month

We've done away with free ElfBuckz and trials (*a vector for abuse and user confusion*), and moved instead to a (*currently informal*) 14-day refund policy.

Details here:

* [Pricing model](/open/pricing/)
* [Trials removed, referrals back](/blog/2024/07/12/plex-debrid-trakt-fixed/)
* [Pricing model announced](/blog/2024/07/10/pricing-model-updated/)

### Referrals are back! :love_letter:

With the transition to monthly billing, and the removal of trials, it's now safe to re-instate the Elf-erral program! 

Here's the deal - every user you refer with [your unique referral code](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/myreferrals) gets $5 off their first order, and **you** get a $5-off coupon! (*\$10 free ElfBuckz, reborn!*)

### Bundle-hopping :rabbit:

With the simplification of pricing tiers and bundles, we can now take advantage of the store's ability to "switch subscription".

For exapmle, if you're on a $29/month Infinite Streaming "starter kit", and you want to upgrade to a Hobbit, the store will automatically handle that for you, and charge you the difference based on your current subscription.

You can also transition between bundles *(i.e. Aars to River, or plex_debrid*) by performing a $0 "*change subscription*" under your account.

!!! note
    "Bundle hopping" isn't supported on pre-paid plans however, but an ElfVenger can manually assist you in this case.

### Comet blazes past RD IP restrictions! :comet:

Newcomer Stremio addon [Comet][comet] was launched, with the unique ability to "proxy stream" your RealDebrid content. This allows a user (*at the expense of ElfHosted's bandwidth*) to share one RealDebrid account across multiple devices in multiple locations, simultaneously, without risking a RealDebrid account ban.

Activating Comet's ProxyStreaming requires an [additional addon from the store,](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/comet-proxy-streaming-addon) to cover the bandwidth usage, but stay tuned for an upcoming "generic" ProxyStreaming addon from the MediaFusion dev, which would allow users to ProxyStream from public addons! (*i.e., you'd still subscribe to the Proxy Streaming feature, but an addon subscription wouldn't be necessary*)

!!! tip "Comet gets revenue sharing! :heart:"
    Comet is an "Elf-illiated" Premium [Stremio Addon][stremio-addons] - the developer maintains an active support channel ([#elf-comet](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1256404447723126916)) in our [Discord][discord] community, the app itself is tuned to work perfectly with ElfHosted "out-of-the-box", and 30% of your subscriptions are contributed to the developer!

### Plex_debrid gets Zilean, fixes :toolbox:

Plex_debrid's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/itsToggle/plex_debrid) has been stale since Dec 2023, and achived since May 2024. Our [attempts to contact the developer](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues/7) to offer stewardship of the project have been unfruitful thus far.

We've had our [own fork](https://github.com/elfhosted/plex_debrid) of the plex_debrid repo for a while, to manage a few fixes (*like Trakt auth*), but \@ron has taken it to a whole new level by adding Zilean support, and a parametized watchlist search interval (*original is hard-coded to 30m*).

(*More details in [this blog post](/blog/2024/07/23/plex-debrid-zilean-support/)*)

### ElfTerm :octicons-terminal-16:

Rather than running your ElfBot commands in the (*janky*) [Filebrowser][filebrowser] CLI, we now have a fully-functional terminal-in-the-browser for this...

[ElfTerm](/how-to/use-elfterm/) is a full POSIX (*fish*) shell on your Filebrowser pod, running inside a tmux session, with state saved to `~/.config`. 

ElfTerm supports all ElfBot commands, includes Kubernetes access via `kubectl`, and allows you to navigate your config and storage volumes via the CLI - useful for advanced renaming / processing of files, examining of symlinks, etc.

### Merch arrived! :gift:

Today, to great delight of my children who all tried to claim it, the first of my [ElfHosted merch](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/merch) arrived!

![](/images/blog/elfhosted-merch-arrived-sticker.jpeg)

(*You, too, could be rocking this fine "[kiss-cut](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/kiss-cut-stickers)" sticker*)

Thanks \@BSM for making the merch happen! :thumbsup:

### RIP Glime, welcome Spanky-9000 :robot:

Our AI Discord bot, Glime, was deprecated by its creators on 15 July. :material-grave-stone:

We have a new AI bot though, Spanky-9000 (*an instance of [Wallubot](https://wallubot.com)*) lurking in our Discord channels. We over-used him and exhausted his credits during July, but I've dialed back his enthusiasm a bit for Aug, and you'll see him popping up to answer questions he feels qualified for. You can also interrogate him directly by \@mentioning him, or posting a question in the [#elf-ai-rtfm](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1194599742487941190) channel!

### PlexTraktSync in ElfTerm :material-plex:

[PlexTraktSync](https://github.com/Taxel/PlexTraktSync) is a tool which syncronises a Plex library with a Trackt library. It's now built into ElfTerm!

Try running `plextrakt sync` to sync your Plex library with your Trakt account - you'll need to jump through a few hoops to setup your Trakt OAuth credentials, but this presents a viable option for users wanting to migrate from plex_debrid to an Arr / Riven design!

### Riven gets 100% revenue :moneybag:

With the advent of hobbit / ranger bundles, we revisited the 30% revenue sharing deal with the Riven developers, and agreed to up our contribution to Riven to... 100%. The rationale is that Riven brings in subscribers, and ElfHosted profits on the Plex-and-friends components, while the Riven devs have a platform to provide support to ElfHosted users.

This month's contribution from 52 ElfHosted users to Riven was... **$US468**! :heart:

### We want your EEPs :ballot_box:

Inspired by [Kubernetes' KEPs](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements), we now have EEPs (*ElfHosted Enhancement Proposals*).

For a view of requested enhancements, and their status, visit [elfhosted/enhancements](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?aq=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)!

## Coming up

### ElfHosted US cluster

We've been working for months on the idea of providing multi-region ElfHosted clusters, both for streaming performance and for disaster recovery planning.

The first of these clusters (*elfhosted.us*) is undergoing private testing with the ElfVengers currently, and should be ready for community testing within a week.

To see if you'd be a viable candidate for a relocation to elfhosted.us, compare your results at https://speed.elfhosted.com with https://speed.elfhosted.us :race_car:

### Your ideas?

Got ideas for improvements? Send us an EEP (*ElfHosted Enhancement Proposal*) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues/new/choose)!

## How to help

If you'd like to make a donation in recognition of our infrastructure costs, our open-source resources, or our friendly support, a simple donation product is available at https://store.elfhosted.com/product/elf-love/ :pray:

Another effective way to help is to drive traffic / organic discovery, by mentioning ElfHosted in appropriate forums such as Reddit's [r/plex](https://reddit.com/r/plex),  [r/realdebrid](https://reddit.com/r/realdebrid), and [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons), which is where much of our target audience is to be found!
