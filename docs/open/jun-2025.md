# "ElfReport" for June 2025

During June, we laid the groundwork for improvements in user experience, migrating all Aarr users to Decypharr, improving our Plex Transcode killer, adding some new trickery to prevent Plex "over-scanning" your RD library and wasting bandwidth.

Behind the scenes, we did some "growing up" on several infrastructure components, in anticipation of the PA cluster build in July 2025.

!!! question "Where's the technical resource summary?"
    This is the first monthly report in our 2-year history without a summary of CPU, memory, network, or pod resource. These have been removed because they only cover the .com DE datacenter, so the .cc US metrics are missing, and with the PA datacenter coming online later this month, having one datacenter's worth of reports is useless at best, and misleading at worst. So, we've dropped the summary entirely in favor of reporting on the past month's progress.

Here's summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/)...

## Retrospective

### Focus on sponsorships

A key value for ElfHosted is contributing back to the developers of the open source applications which we host. Wherever possible, we like to "[Elf-illiate](https://store.elfhosted.com/affiliate/)" with developers, providing a Discord channel and a consolidated and easy way our users to engage, but we still want to support the tools and platforms which don't engage that way, or have their own, separate communities.

Our [sponsorship](/sponsorship/) page has been significantly updated, highlighting our various efforts to engage and thank the developers whose work underpin our platforms.

### Aars now exclusively on Decypharr

During a quiet period, we carefully upgraded several key storage components in our two clusters. The primary user impact was a migration of all remaining Aarr users to Decypharr over Zurg for their RD storage mount.

### Transcoder Killer UX improvements

Plex has the unhelpful feature (for us) of happily trying to "transcode" your video streams, to be as compatible as possible with every playback device, based on what it detects about your Plex client, and how fast it thinks your connection is. Some Plex apps also have conservative defaults, like limiting any remote playback to 720P!

This means, if you have a 80GB 4K HDR media file, and you try to watch it on a 720P, 2-channel chromecast, by default Plex will expend huge resources "transcoding" that beautiful, high-fidelity 🖼️ content to make it look like a soggy potato 🥔.

Transcodes can be extremely "expensive" in terms of CPU and GPU resources, and the end result is never as good as "DirectPlaying" the content. We strongly encourage users to store media at resolutions / qualities which they know their playback devices can play without transcoding. (the Radarr/Sonarr bundles have dual-aars for the purpose of managing multiple resolutions in a library, in case you're sharing with less-equipped friends). While we do enable hardware transcoding on Hobbits and larger packages, this is limited to 1080P and worse, since even 4K hardware transcodes are still far too resource-intensive.

So, we employ a "transcode-killer", a script which watches our nodes for resource-expensive transcodes, and.. kills them. From the user perspective, this looks like you're starting a stream, and then Plex stops with an error about "conversion failed", or "transcoder failed", depending on your particular client.

As a UX improvement, we moved the "killing" process from our underlying nodes to the individual Plex pods, so that :one: users can "see" the killed transcode details via ElfBot logs, and :two: users receive an email with those same details.

### Plex Scanner Trickery

During the Zurg-to-Decypharr transition, we discovered that Plex relies on the filesystem's `modtime` value to identify whether or not media in the library has changed, and if it **has** changed, Plex happily re-analyzes/re-probes **any** changed media.. which is hugely wasteful of RD bandwidth, since the files are not going to have changed. Ever.

We augmented our Plex pods with a "shim" (*we do love our shims!*) which will convince Plex to skip scanning any media it's already scanned, but will re-scan media if new content appears (*due to a repair, another resolution being added, etc*)

### Mooar Apps

#### PlexyTrack

[PlexyTrack](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/plexytrack/) synchronizes your Plex library with Trakt. Besides watched history it can optionally add items to your Trakt collection, sync ratings and watchlists, and now mirrors Trakt lists you like as Plex collections. 

Collections created in Plex will in turn appear as Trakt lists. A small Flask web interface lets you choose which features to enable and configure the sync interval. Items that are manually marked as watched in Plex are detected as well. The interface also includes a tool for creating backups of your history, watchlist and ratings.

**Features**

* Bidirectional sync of watched history between Plex and Trakt or Simkl
* Optional synchronization of ratings, collections, liked lists and watchlists
* Live Sync mode to trigger updates immediately from Plex webhooks
* Simple backup and restore of all your Trakt data from the web interface
* Intuitive UI for configuration and user selection

#### PeerTube

[PeerTube](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/peertube/) is an open-source, federate-able video hosting platform. We use it for https://video.elfhosted.com. A hosted PeerTube would get you your "own" YouTube, with content stored in your own external (S3-compatible) cloud storage, and the resources of a dedicated ElfHosted node for transcoding.

## Coming up

### US East Coast DC (July 2025)

Due to a combination of confused freight operators, and the 4th July long weekend, our PA infrastructure was delayed **again**. The go-live date for the new infrastructure is now targetted as the 17/18th July, meaning with a testing / bedding-in period, `elfhosted.party` should be ready for partying from Aug 2025! (*our 2-year prod-aversary*) :cake:!

!!! question "Didn't you say **this** month was our birthday?"
    Yes. I was confused. [Aug 2023](/open/august-2023/) was our first month "in prod", but we spent the two prior months "building in public".

### Birthday treats :cake:

Next month (*Aug 2025*) is our second production birthday! (*To see how far we've come, check out our [2023](/open/july-2023/) and [2024](/open/jul-2024/) reports*).

All going well, we hope to:

* Have our US DC ready for users to migrate to
* Announce a new loyalty program (*ElfPoints*) which we're currently trialing
* Announce a new sponsored community resource

Stay tuned!

### Even mooar apps

Apps currently requested can be found (and submitted!) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Notable suggestions:

* [TitleCardMaker](https://titlecardmaker.com/) (*CLI version for now*)

#### Dispatcharr (July 2025)

[Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) is described as:

> ..an open-source powerhouse for managing IPTV streams and EPG data with elegance and control.
Born from necessity and built with passion

Or..

> Think of Dispatcharr as the *arr family’s IPTV cousin — simple, smart, and designed for streamers who want reliability and flexibility.

We're still at the proof-of-concept stage, and we've not had much success with Plex/Jellyfin/Emby-integrated IPTV (*[ChannelsDVR][channelsdvr] works great though!*), but if you're interested in helping to beta-test, then shout out!

### Zurgling 2.0 (one day)

Hot-off-the-press, the [latest Zurg/DMM Patreon update](https://www.patreon.com/posts/stability-and-130991643) indicates:

> What's Coming
> 
> DMM Integration
> 
> Subscribe to content on DMM website
> 
> Subscribed content automatically added to your Zurg server
> 
> Similar to how Sonarr/Radarr monitor and grab releases

We're excited about this because it would be a significant quality-of-life improvement for [Zurgling](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/zurgling/) users, retaining the intended simplicity of their stacks, but automating away some of the human "clickops" required to add new content to their libraries.
