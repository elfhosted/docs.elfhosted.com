# "ElfReport" for July 2025

This report is being published a month late, thanks primarily to the terrible track record of UPS, in shipping hardware to our new PA datacenter. On 3 separate occasions, the hardware was so damaged as to need be replaced, dragging out the rollout an embarrasingly long time!

During July, we celebrated our second birthday by bringing our 3rd datacenter (`elfhosted.party`) online, on the US East coast! We now give back 20% credit to subscribers, have a "grown up" UI for ElfBot (*no more CLI for ENV vars!*), and provide doubling the streaming limits for all the Stremio addons (4K) out-of-the-box.

Here's summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/)...

## Retrospective

### ElfBot rocks your world

Since inception, we've had our trusty little CLI tool "ElfBot" to help restart apps, set environment variables, and perform basic admin. 

It's been a little hard to use, especially on mobile, so for our second birthday, we commissioned a huge upgrade..

.. meet ElfBot (UI)!

### ElfPoints gets you 20% credit back

To reward long-term Elfies, we've hatched a reward scheme, "ElfPoints". You can read more details [here](https://docs.elfhosted.com/how-to/earn-elfpoints/), but in short, we give you 20% credit back on your subscription renewals, which you can use to "pimp your stack" by adding other apps. The bigger your bundle, the more ElfPoints you get to spend on toys.

As a thank you to the Elfies who've been with us the longest, we retroactively applied these credits to any renewals during 2025, so if you're an OG Elfie, you may have a nice little stash waiting for you to play with!

!!! tip "Earn mooar ElfPoints"
    You can also [earn](https://docs.elfhosted.com/how-to/earn-elfpoints/) **more** ElfPoints with promotional activities, like reviews, referrals, and having a subscription-versarry!

### Discord gets exclusive

Wanting to further protect the privacy of our users, and to better reflect the premium access that our subscribers get, we've made our Discord channels more exclusive.

While non-subscribers (*"muggles" ?*) still have access to our public (*read-only*) channels for status updates, help tickets and so forth, we've kept the community / app-specific channels for active subscribers only.

[Link your Discord account to your ElfHosted subscription](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/discord/) for access to the community channels, and enjoy some of the [extra benefits in our Discord server](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/07/09/link-your-store-account-to-maintain-your-discord-access/)!

(More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/07/19/claim-your-vip-discord-access/))

### Stremio Addons get 4K proxying :rocket:

Our proxy-capable Stremio addons got a boost from their default 64kbps (HD) limit, up to 150Mbps, enough for a comfortable 4K stream, or 2 HD streams. 

Boosting is still possible for users who need moooar speed, and all existing boosters also got doubled.

(More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/07/31/stremio-bundled-proxy-streaming-boosts-to-4k/))

### Cleanarr replaces Declutarr

Some users were using Declutarr, a CLI-based tool for cleaning out Aarr queues, retrying failed / stalled downloads, etc. Users reported issues with Declutarr's results, and debugging it via a web-based CLI terminal was complex.

Decluttarr has been "decluttered" now, and replaced with a shiny new alternative, [Cleanuparr](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/cleanuparr), whose developer is [Elf-illiated](/sponsorship/)

(More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/07/26/cleanuparr-cleans-up-decluttarr-booklore-gets-a-demo/))

### Plex gets auto-trash back (if you want)

Now that [Plex][plex] (*and [Jellyfin][jellyfin] / [Emby][emby]*) are able to automatically restart themselves and pause to wait for your debrid storage to mount, it's less likely that an storage event will cause Plex to auto-empty your library.

Several users requested auto-trash-emptying in their Plex stacks, and since this is now low-risk, we've made the auto-trash feature optional again. Set it or don't set it, it's up to you!

(More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2025/07/21/plex-gets-auto-trashing-back-optionally/))

### Mooar Apps

#### Wger

An antitheses to the traditional couch-potato apps, Wger was added at user request - it's a server with a web UI and mobile app, to track your health and fitness. Wger crowd-sources exercises and dietary info, and helps you keep track of your progress over time.

See [Wger in the store](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/wger/)!

## Coming up

### US East Coast DC redundancy (Sept 2025)

While **some** hardware is running in our East Coast DC (`.elfhosted.party`), it's still not as resilient and scalable as we'd like. The remaining hardware is being (re)assembled and deployed during Aug/Sep 2025, ensuring we have lots of capacity for the holiday season!

### Even mooar apps

Apps currently requested can be found (and submitted!) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Notable suggestions:

* [TitleCardMaker](https://titlecardmaker.com/) (*CLI version for now*)
