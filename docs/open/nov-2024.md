title: Elf-Disclosure / Nov 2024
description: November was a month of fancy footwork and rapid pivoting, as first torrentio and then RealDebrid threw us curveballs, all while we were trying to gear up for Black Friday! Here some geeky stats, a retrospective, and a look ahead for ElfHosted from Nov 2024

# "Elf-Disclosure" for Nov 2024

November was **intended** to be a month of scaling in preparation for Black Friday / Christmas growth, but ended up being a month of rapid pivoting! [Torrentio experienced a multi-day outage](https://debrid.news/torrentio-goes-away-for-a-day/), significantly increasing the load on our [public Stremio addons](https://elfhosted.com/stremio-addons/), and resulting in the addition of dedicated hardware for MediaFusion's mongoDB database as a stopgap.

The following week saw the [withdrawl of cached-torrent-checking support at RealDebrid](https://debrid.news/realdebrid-blocks-pirates-pirates-panic/), followed quickly by the same from AllDebrid and Debrid-Link, which once again caused instability in the [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons) world, as well as impacting a subset of infinite streaming users (*for a time*).

The US datacenter once again got > 100% more capacity, we upgraded the store theme, introduced a new "lite" streaming stack (Zurglings), and weathered the Black Friday chaos!

To get us started, here are some shiny stats for Nov 2024, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/)...

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    The stats below illustrate CPU cores used (*not percentage*). These stats only cover the DE cluster at present, we're working on cross-cluster metrics aggregation to make this data more useful.

    CPU load is 20% higher than the previous month, both on the tenant workloads and on the core shared components, which can be attributed to natural growth.

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire (DE) cluster. Tenant memory usage increased 36% from the previous month, and apps which run on daemonsets (*i.e., a pod on every node*) show increased memory usage as a result of the expansion on nodes, as well as tenant growth.

    Other high consumers of RAM:

    * **csi-rclone**: used for mounting all rclone-compatible storage mounts, primarily RealDebrid libraries
    * **kube-system**: the Kubernetes control plane, including the cilium agents which manage the networking / policy enforcement (*currently 11K flows/s across 30 nodes*)
    * **traefik**: all inbound access to the cluster / services
    * **[mediafusion][mediafusion]**: an excellent (*but RAM-hungry!*) [Stremio addon](/stremio-addons/)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    The regular spikes on the contended nodes (*hansels*) warrant investigation. They may be routine, or the result of a misconfigured app. The gretel network ingress also seems unusually higher than the egress, which may indicate that once again, Plex is downloading content for local analysis, without actually streaming it back out again.
    
    !!! tip "Why Hansel & Gretel?"
        Bundles are datacenter-agnostic, but nodes are specific to each datacenter, and we needed a way to differentiate US nodes from DE nodes. The fairy tale of [Hansel and Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel) originates in Germany :flag_de:

## Retrospective

### US cluster

Since last month, the US cluster has grown from 33 to 45 users, and we've once again added >100% capacity (*7 new yankees, bringing us to 13 in total*).

Here's what the US cluster looks like today (*compare this with the `kubectl top` output in the CPU/RAM sections above*):

If you'd like to gauge whether the US cluster would be more suitable for your workloads, visit https://speed.elfhosted.com and perform some comparative tests!

### US East Coast DC

We don't have an ETA yet, but our US DC supplier have built out their Pennsylvania (PA) datacenter on the east coast, and we've indicated interest in establishing a presence there. With a PA datacenter on the east coast, and the existing WA datacenter on the west coast, we'd be better able to serve our US Elfies!

Please submit your suggestions for what the DNS suffix and node names should be!

### Mooar apps

The following apps made their debut on ElfHosted during November 2024:

#### Actual

[Actual][actual] Budget is a super fast and privacy-focused app for managing your finances. At its heart is the well proven and much loved Envelope Budgeting methodology.

![Screenshot of Actual](/images/screenshots/actual.png){ loading=lazy }

You own your data and can do whatever you want with it. Featuring multi-device sync, optional end-to-end encryption and so much more.

#### JellyStat

[Jellystat][jellystat] records and displays beautiful statistics from your Jellyfin server (*like what [Tautulli][tautulli] does for [Plex][plex]*), and is now included in our Jellyfin bundles.

![Screenshot of JellyStat](/images/screenshots/jellystat.png){ loading=lazy }

#### SuggestArr

[SuggestArr][suggestarr] is a project designed to automate media content recommendations and download requests based on user activity in media servers like Jellyfin, Plex, and now Emby. 

![Screenshot of Suggestarr](/images/screenshots/suggestarr.png){ loading=lazy }

It retrieves recently watched content, searches for similar titles using the TMDb API, and sends automated download requests to Jellyseer or Overseer.

#### Calibre-Web Automated

We've had [Calibre-Web][calibre-web] available from day 1, but during November we transitioned to "Calibre Web Automated", which super-charges the **regular** Calibre-Web with:

- Automatic Imports ✨
- Automatic Conversion 🔃
- A Weighted Conversion Algorithm: ⚖️
- 28 Supported file types for conversion
- Automatic Enforcement of Changes made to Covers & Metadata through the Calibre-Web UI! 👀📔
- One Step Full Library Conversion 🔂 - Any format -> .epub
- Library Auto-Detect 📚🕵️
- Easy Dark/ Light Mode Switching ☀️🌙
- Batch Editing & Deletion! 🗂️🗄️

More details in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/11/12/calibre-web-gets-automated/)

### Improved store

Last month we forecast making some changes to enable express checkout in the store, and we used the impending Black Friday sale as a motivator to get this across the line. The following areas are vastly improved:

#### Express checkout with Apple/Google Pay

For complicated technical reasons, our Apple/Google Pay buttons weren't appearing on checkout because WooCommerce (*and possible the gateways themselves*) won't allow them to be shown for a $0 purchase, which is what a subscription with a free trial period looks like, to the gateway.

Until this issue is solved by the bugs we've lodged upstream, and judging that the benefit of offering Apple/Google pay vastly outweights the added friction, whenever a product includes a free trial, we've added a $1 signup fee, so that option to pay with Apple/Google Pay appears again.

#### Wishlist support

You can now "wishlist" any product in the store, which theoretically (*still waiting evidence of this working "in the wild"*) will email you when that product goes on sale, or comes back into stock.

#### Improved theme

One of the primary motivations for transitioning to the new theme was to improve the checkout and the user dashboard experience, both of which should now look and work better, on desktop and mobile!

### TrustPilot 

We now have a [TrustPilot page](https://nz.trustpilot.com/review/elfhosted.com)! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

![TrustPilot screenshot](/images/reports/2024-11/trustpilot-screenshot.png)

We're at 10 reviews with an average of 4.3 out of 5, and your review would help us tremendously, so please go [here](https://nz.trustpilot.com/review/elfhosted.com), and leave your honest review!

(*if you're unhappy though, please reach out to us first so we can make you happy beforehand!*)

### Zilean

Zilean is a scraper which indexers [publicly shared DebridMediaManager hashes](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/hashlists), parsing them in such a way that the collection can be searched by Stremio addons, Riven, and Prowlarr indexers.

Zilean is also used by popular addons like [Comet](https://comet.elfhosted.com) and [MediaFusion](https://mediafusion.elfhosted.com), which began to be adopted by the (*massive*) [r/Addons4Kodi](https://reddit.com/r/Addons4Kodi) community.

Rather than having the public, just-in-time (*resource-intensive*) indexers scraped for what was essentially the public DMM hashes, we opted to expose a *public* Zilean instance, so that Kodi/Prowlarr users can scrape Zilean directly, which is far more resource-efficient.

The public Zilean instance is free to use without rate-limits (*at present*), since it's so efficiently cached, at https://zilean.elfhosted.com/scalar/v2

### Project Zyclops

On the back of the public Zilean announcement, we unveiled "Project Zyclops", an Elf-sclusive configuration of Zilean and Zurg, to make all hashes in all our elfies' RealDebrid libraries available as scraping source for Zilean. This increased our (*internal*) Zilean's hashes by 10%, and this number will only grow as more users join #teamelf!

More details (*and some geeky flowcharts*) in [this blog post](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/11/19/project-zycops-is-a-go/)

### Zurglings

Due to the RealDebrid instantAvailability API removal, many users found themselves (*for a period*) unable to search for and add new content. [DebridMediaManager](https://debridmediamanager.com) reacted quickly, building their own ["crowd-sourced" cache](https://www.patreon.com/posts/rd-is-dead-long-116759399) of known-to-be-cached torrents, making DMM a more-popular-than-ever way to find content to add to your RealDebrid library.

Our @Layezee had the brilliant idea of offering a "lite" version of our starter kits, without any automation (*no plex_debrid, Riven, or Aars*), but integrated quickly and easily into the DMM workflow. 

As a result, existing users who were "dead-in-the-water", or new users who wanted something that worked "better than Stremio", could grab a "Zurgling", plug in their RD credentials, setup Plex, and happily add content to their library using DMM.

Here's our setup video to illustrate how easy it is:

### Wizards

Scratching another common itch, a [Wizard](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/wizard/) is a one-time assist with a particular app or bundle setup. Wizards are a VIP, white-glove session with our existing knowledgeable and friendly ElfVengers. 

The idea is that users wanting a "hands-off", "just-do-it-for-me" configuration can lock in a private session with an ElfVenger for the particular app/bundle they need solved, and work together on a one-to-one basis to delivery maximum geeky happiness!

### Giftcards 

Elfies are typically friendly and generous geeks, and since a season of rest and gift-giving is approaching, we thought you might want to give the gift of "Elfie-ness" (*and endless tinkering*) to friends / family.

We now offer [gift cards](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/gift-cards/) in the store, at a range of price points intended to match our popular bundles.

## Coming up

### Hetzner scheduled maintenance

We underwent some of Hetzner's schedule maintenance during November, but there are more windows coming up in December, and if your .com (DE) nodes are listed [here](https://store.elfhosted.com/blog/2024/10/25/dodging-a-flurry-of-maintenance/), then you'll be impacted by Hetzner's maintenance schedule, for up to 2 hours.

### Even mooar apps

Apps currently requested can be found (and submitted!) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)

Notable suggestions:

* [TitleCardMaker](https://titlecardmaker.com/) (*CLI version for now*)

### Guide / blog refresh (ongoing)

While we've completed the migration of the blog from the docs site to the store, the refreshing of our guides is still on the short-term to-do list.

Now that we have a mostly-workable theme for the store, the ElfVengers and I will be moving much of the guides from the docs site (https://elfhosted.com) to the store, since this is more suitable for frequent, collaborative edits.

We're not sure yet exactly where the division should be, but the docs site should remain technical and price-agnostic, whereas the store should present what we offer, commercially, as simply and attractively as possible.

### Multi-debrid support

This is alreadly partly in place, but during December we'll be working (*alongside the guide updates, above*) on getting better coverage across multiple debrid platforms, including TorBox, AllDebrid, and Debrid-Link (*the cached-checking endpoint changes sort of threw a wrench in this!*)

### Cautious for Christmas

We're going to try to avoid any overly-optimistic changes during December - everyone is looking forward to a Christmas break, and they'll be looking for stability and reliability, plus our ElfVengers and I may be less available over the period. 

So we'll continue applying upstream updates to packages during our daily "glowup" over the holidays, but we'll try to avoid making any dramatic infrastructure or platform changes.

### Your ideas?

Got ideas for improvements? Send us an EEP (*ElfHosted Enhancement Proposal*) [here](https://github.com/elfhosted/enhancements/issues/new/choose)!

## How to help

Another effective way to help is to drive traffic / organic discovery, by mentioning ElfHosted in appropriate forums such as Reddit's [r/plex](https://reddit.com/r/plex),  [r/realdebrid](https://reddit.com/r/realdebrid), and [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons), which is where much of our target audience is to be found!
