# Pricing

This page describes the ElfHosted pricing model. It used to be a complicated, over-engineered process of measuring app resource usage, picking the average of the top 20%, and calculating a per-day rate per app, which was expected to vary over time.

Nobody understood it, and it was very hard to report on!

Rather than being an AWS-like provider of bare-metal resources, ElfHosted has grown more of a full-service PaaS, with heavy investment in UX, community building and support (*ElfVengers, merch store, AI bot, etc)*.

In July 2024, we [rolled out](/blog/2024/07/10/pricing-model-updated/) the following, simplified model, based on app tiers.

1. Standalone apps: $9/month
2. Complex apps: $19/month
3. Starter pack bundles: $29/month
4. Hobbit bundles: $39/month
5. Ranger bundles: $59/month

Since the bundles / periods are now standardized, users will be able to upgrade / "cross-grade" and have the store automatically prorate the current subscription.
