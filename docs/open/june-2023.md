# "ElfReport" for June 2023

It's been a month since ElfHosted was born! :baby:

I've worked way **more** than I expected, and the work has been **harder** than I expected, but I've immensely enjoyed the challenge of building something **fast** and **in public**.

What follows here are our recent changes, the current stats - time/money spent, revenue (haha), and lots of data / graphs re the current state of the platform.

## What's new/next?

=== ":material-calendar: June 2023"

    Here's what we achieved in June 2023 (*not an exhaustive list, there's only so much space!*):

    * [x] [Prod website][elfhosted] based on (*you guessed it!*) mkdocs-material (*look familiar?*)
    * [x] HA, fault-tolerant K3s Kubernetes cluster (*3 servers, 3 agents, 3 ceph nodes*)
    * [x] Dedicated CI environment for pre-testing infrastructure changes
    * [x] BYO storage / VPN fully self-service when purchasing via the [store][elfhosted/store]
    * [x] All previously supported Seedplicity [apps][elfhosted/apps] available [^5]
    * [x] CLI tool (*[ElfBot][elfhosted/elfbot]*) for self-service app restarts, backups, resets

=== ":dart: July 2023"

    Here's what's on the short-list for prioritization next:

    * [ ] Bring BYOVPN config to Deluge and ruTorrent
    * [ ] Add new apps to support Premiumize
    * [ ] Migrate to prod store, make bundles easier to manage
    * [ ] Regular daily maintenance period for app updates / maintenance
    * [ ] Load test with more users!

## Resources

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    Most apps consume almost no CPU while idle - the larger consumers are streamers doing transcoding, and download clients doing download/unpack operations:

=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire cluster. By far the largest consumers of RAM are the storage platforms (longhorn and ceph):

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    I'm not sure these stats are accurate, they've likely overly high because pods on the host network (like metallb, ceph, etc) will end up counting **all** traffic on each host, rather than the pod itself. This is an outstanding issue to fix!

=== ":octicons-graph-16: Ingress/Egress"

    These are the traffic stats for egress from Hetzner. They exclude any traffic to/from Hetzner Storageboxes:

=== ":fontawesome-solid-cow: Longhorn"

    Longhorn provides RWX volumes for `/config`, and for some infrastructure components like Prometheus, Chartmuseum, etc.

=== ":simple-ceph: Ceph"

    Ceph provides optional storage ("ElfStorage"), typically used for long-term slow storage and seeding:

[^1]: Much of this is yearly fees for Wordpress plugins
[^2]: Yes, that's a **lot**! This is the opportunity cost, over a month, of focusing on ElfHosted rather than billable consulting work!
[^3]: Total spend includes yearly payments for Wordpress plugins, etc
[^4]: Low egress is good, because ingress is always free, but Hetzner charges for egress after 20TB!
[^5]: Except Minio, which we're not bringing back!
[^6]: All moneyz are in US dollarz!
