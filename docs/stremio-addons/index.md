# ElfHosted Stremio Addons

[Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) is a popular streaming application with a developer-friendly ecosystem of addons, whose purposes range from finding subtitles, to creating catalogues, to finding content to stream. Stremio is a popular solution for media streaming, due to its wide range of hardware support, including "cheap" hardware which is unsupported by [Plex][plex].

Combined with [debrid][real-debrid] solutions, Stremio plus addons can provide "instant" access to your favorite media quickly and easily.

In support of the Stremio community, we offer free highly-available hosting for addons, with rate-limits to prevent abuse. Donations to support hosting are [gratefully accepted](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/elf-love), and subscription-based instances are also available with 10 x higher rate-limits, and SSO to secure them.
