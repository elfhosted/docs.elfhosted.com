It all started with a browser tab and a dream.

I’d hop between random streaming sites, dodging fake “Play” buttons like I was in an obstacle course. Half the time, I’d spend longer trying to get to the movie than actually watching it. But back then, that was normal. It worked. Kinda.

Eventually, I discovered Stremio, and everything changed. Suddenly, things were smooth.... organised. I felt like I’d upgraded from a tin can phone to a spaceship. But there were still limits. I wanted more control, more quality, more permanence.

So I moved on to a seedbox. And wow, what a jump. I was running my own setup with [Radarr][radarr] and [Sonarr][sonarr], grabbing content and feeding it into [Plex][plex]. It was fast, powerful, and made me feel like I had my own little digital cinema.

But… there were still downsides.

Even with fast downloads, I had to wait. Storage filled up faster than I could manage it. And maintaining everything felt like a part time job. I just wanted things to work .. without me constantly babysitting the system.

That’s when I stumbled on a Reddit post mentioning something called [ElfHosted](https://store.elfhosted.com).

I clicked. I read. I signed up. And I haven’t looked back.

ElfHosted took everything I was trying to do and just did it better. Unlimited storage with clever symlink magic. Full automation with Plex, Radarr, Sonarr etc etc. No worrying about Linux commands.. It just works, beautifully.

Now my media shows up instantly, my storage is effectively infinite, and I get to enjoy everything from any device, anywhere - without the hassle.

ElfHosted didn’t just improve my setup - it perfected it.

Honestly, I just wanted to watch something.
Now I run a media command centre.

Thanks, elves.
