# It started in a dorm room.

While others were chasing majors or parties, I was burning DVDs—stacks of them—organizing rentals with a clipboard, a signup sheet, and blind faith in the honor system. I wasn’t just a student… I was a one-man blockbuster. A media vigilante.

After graduation, I evolved.

The DVDs gave way to a basement Plex server. One NAS became two, then four bays, then eight—each upgrade a new chapter in my saga. For fifteen years, I nurtured that beast. It was my fortress, my legacy. But like all great machines, it eventually fell. The Synology died. The empire crumbled.

I stood at a crossroads: drop thousands on another NAS rebuild... or find a new way.

So I searched.

Cloud hosting. Seedboxes. Sketchy Reddit threads. And then, like a whisper in the dark, I found it: [ElfHosted](https://store.elfhosted.com). I clicked. I lurked. I doubted. But something about it... felt right.

I started small—just the basic [Plex][plex] and AARs package. Within days, I knew: this was it. The performance. The simplicity. The elegance. I leveled up to the [Ranger Plan](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/ranger) without hesitation.

I’ve tried [Riven][riven]. I’ve danced with the add-ons. But I always return to the Holy AARs. There’s a reason they’re the core.

Now? My ElfHosted library sits at 390TB and counting. Friends and family stream effortlessly. Dolby Vision lights up the AV room like a beacon. And I, once a dorm-room disc hustler, now reign as the provider of all things watchable.

This isn’t just storage. This is destiny.
