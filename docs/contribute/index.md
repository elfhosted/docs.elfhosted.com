# Contribute

Want to give back to the ElfHosted community? We'd be grateful - we currently run on goodwill and optimism! Here are a few suggestions for helpful ways to contribute:

## Be an Elf-vangelist

We grow by word-of-mouth referrals and organic search results. One of the most impactful ways to help is to post about ElfHosted online - every link back to `elfhosted.com` increases our organic search relevance, and makes us more discoverable to future elves.

Our target-market has so far primarily come from:

* Google searches
* [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons)
* [r/seedboxes](https://reddit.com/r/seedboxes)
* [LowEndSpirit](https://lowendspirit.com/) / [LowEndTalk](https://lowendtalk.com)

Possible approaches for further exposure would be app-specific subreddits (*[r/Plex](https://reddit.com/r/plex), [r/Jellyfin](https://reddit.com/r/jellyfin), etc*), or approaching open-source devs to offer free hosted demos / instances of their app, such as [Annatar](https://annatar.elfhosted.com).

If you post a link using your [referral code](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/myreferrals/), any referees would get $5 off their first ElfBuckz top-up, and you'd get a token $1 ElfBuckz in thanks!

!!! tip
    It's a good idea to disclose any referral / affiliate links as such, for transparency, and to avoid backlash

## Join the Elf-vengers

Our [Discord server][discord] is a welcoming, friendly community of geeks, and the Elf-Vengers are our elite team of Discord-based volunteers who support current and future elves, as they make their journey from "*$10-free-elfbuckz-whut-now?*" to "*just symlink from debrid and import with the arrr, bro*".

Check out the details and join the [team here](/team/)!

## Create How-to videos

All our documentation is text-based, which is difficult for some users to parse easily, especially non-native English-speakers. If you've got skillz / interest in creating howto videos, these would unlock a whole new subscriber base we're currently missing!

## Update / add documentation

Got some documentation improvements to suggest? This site is built with mkdocs and material-mkdocs - you can spin up [a browser-based development enviroment](https://gitpod.io/new/#https://github.com/geek-cookbook/elfhosted.com) using GitPod, prepare a changeset, and submit a PR all from one browser window!

## Improve product images

The images in the store are a little inconsistent, and lack polish and branding. Re-doing the store images to make them all properly sized / fonted / etc would improve the polish and "look" of the store significantly.

## Wordpress administration

If you've got experience and interest in running a Wordpress / Woocommerce store (*including managing categories, updating product descriptions, etc*), you could make a significant contribution in this area!

## Resources (branding)

If you're looking to make a blog post / article about ElfHosted, here are some images of our mascot, "Spanky the Elf", which might be useful:

### SVG

#### Spanky Only

<figure markdown>
  ![](/images/logo.svg){ width="250" }
  <figcaption>Spanky in SVG</figcaption>
</figure>

### Transparent PNG
