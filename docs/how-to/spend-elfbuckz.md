# ElfBuckz

"ElfBuckz" is our "in-store credits" system, originally used for daily app subscriptions, but now only used for account refunds / credits.

## ElfBuckz Balance / Topup

To see your ElfBuckz balance, visit your [account page](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/account-funds/). From here you can perform a one-time topup, but you can also [subscribe to a monthly topup](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/elfbuckz-topup/), if you prefer to maintain a credit balance.

## Spending ElfBuckz

Simply use ElfBuckz as your payment gateway when buying app subscriptions, or use your balance as a part-payment when using a regular payment gateway.
