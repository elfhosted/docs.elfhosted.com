# Reviews

If you're a happy Elfie, we'd love if it if you'd leave a review of your subscribed apps, ElfHosted in general, or both!

We'll thank you for every 5-star[^1] product review with 500 ElfPoints (*$5 spendable in the store*)!

## Store Review

To review any product you've purchased on the store, ensure you're logged in, and review [your orders](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/orders/).

Each order includes the product description - click the description, and you will be directed to the product page in the store. Scroll down to the description, and click on the "Reviews" tab, then fill out your own review.

## TrustPilot

The store **should** send you an automated invite requesting a TrustPilot review, 2 weeks after purchase. You can, however, simple visit https://www.trustpilot.com/review/elfhosted.com and leave a review manually. We can't reward you for a TrustPilot review (*against their TOS*), but we'be be very grateful, regardless!

[^1]: If you're not 5-star satisfied, [get in touch](/get-help/) and we'll try our best to remedy that!
