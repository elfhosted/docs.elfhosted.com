# How to get your Plex Token

Several of ElfHosted's apps ([Zurg][zurg], [plex-debrid][plex-debrid], [Riven][riven]..) need to interact with your [Plex][plex] instance, using a token.

To get a Plex token, visit https://plex-token-generator.elfhosted.com, and generate a token.

Enter an arbitrary product name (*the name of the app you're connecting would make sense*), an arbitrary client ID (*you can click the button to generate this*), and click `Generate Pin`:

The PIN will be pre-populated. Click `Link` (*and then you can close this window*)
