# What are ElfPoints?

"ElfPoints" are our loyalty / reward currency, intended to thank our subscribers for long-term subscriptions, and to provide credit for extra apps to [streaming bundle](https://store.elfhosted.com/product-category/streaming-bundles/) subscribers.

You "[earn](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/lws_woorewards/)" ElfPoints every time you spend money, or completing other promotional activities.

## Earn ElfPoints

### Spending

The primary method for earning ElfPoints is simply **having** an active subscription. We'll credit you 20% of the value of each subscription renewal in ElfPoints, and you can then use those ElfPoints to purchase additional subscriptions using your [ElfPoints Wallet](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/lws_wallet/).

### Reviewing

For every [review](/how-to/leave-a-review/) you post of a product you've purchased, we'll credit you with 500 ElfPoints (*$5 spendable credit*), up to twice per month.

### Referring

Every time you use our [pay-it-forward referral system](https://store.elfhosted.com/pay-it-forward/), you [earn ElfPoints](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/lws_woorewards/), when your referrees click, register, or spend.

### Stick around

We'll award you 1000 ElfPoints (*$10 credit*) on the anniversary of your registration. Happy ElfBirthday! :cake:

## Spending ElfPoints

To spend ElfPoints on an eligible[^1] new subscription, pick "ElfPoints Wallet" as your payment gateway on checkout. Provided your [ElfPoints Wallet](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/lws_wallet/) has enough credit, it will continue to fund the subscription through ongoing monthly renewals.

    Answer: Yes, mostly. ElfBuckz is still used in edge cases *(BTC-based subscriptions, or staff-managed account credits*), but its use is very limited and specific.

!!! question "Can I transfer my ElfPoints to another user?"

    Answer: No, ElfPoints are non-transferrable.

!!! question "Can I top up my ElfPoints with cash?"

    Answer: No, ElfPoints can only be **earned**, not topped-up.
