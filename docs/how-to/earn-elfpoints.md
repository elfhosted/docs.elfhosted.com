You "[earn](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/elfpoints/)" ElfPoints every time you spend money, or completing other promotional activities.

## Earn ElfPoints

### Earn 20% back on every renewal

With each subscription renewal, youâ€™ll receive ElfPoints worth 20% of its value, automatically added to your [ElfPoints Wallet](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/wallet/). You can then use those points to purchase a new subscription or renew an existing one.

### Earn $5 for every review

    Answer: No, ElfPoints can only be **earned**, not topped-up.
