# "Outsource" your unRAID media management/aquisition to ElfHosted

unRAID is an incredibly popular platform for home media management, providing storage, apps, and virtualization. Many happy geeks are running a local unRAID platform, maintaining their own "data hoard", and using platform to run media streaming apps (*[Plex][plex], [Jellyfin][jellyfin], [Emby][emby], etc*) locally at home.

## Why ElfHosted?

ElfHosted plus a [Hetzner StorageBox]( https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box) compliments the unRAID setup perfectly, providing:

* [x] Cost-effective remote storage when you need more capacity for media you don't care to store at home
* [x] Transparent mounting of this storage into the local unRAID for local consumption
* [x] "outsourcing" of media management/aquisition apps ([Radarr][radarr], [Sonarr][sonarr], [qBittorrent][qbittorrent], etc)
* [x] Possibility of sharing media without exposing your home unRAID instance to the internet

!!! tip "Torrent to unRAID without requiring a VPN"
    Importantly, with ElfHosted's BYO VPN design, you can run [qBittorrent][qbittorrent], [Deluge][deluge], or [ruTorrent][rutorrent], saving data directly to your Storagebox, and consume it locally at home on unRAID, without having to secure and manage the torrent client / VPN components at home!

## Step-by-step

### What you'll need:

* [x] A VPN (*either a [supported provider](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/tree/main/setup/providers), or your own custom Wireguard / OpenVPN config*)
* [x] A Hetzner Storagebox in the Germany location

### Aquire a Hetzner Storagebox

Pick your [preferred size storagebox](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box), ensuring it's located in the Germany / FSN1 / Falkenstein location. This is **your storage**, to keep or expand as you please.

Enable **Samba Support**, and **External Reachability**:

Reset your password (*you're not given one initially*) and store it securely.

!!! question "What do we have now?"
    You have a storagebox which you can access remotely

### Connect to unRAID

Ensure your unRAID has "[Unassigned Devices](https://github.com/dlandon/unassigned.devices)" app installed:

Navigate to the plugin and select "**Add Remote SMB/NFS Share**":

When prompted to choose a protocol, click on the "Windows icon" to choose SMB:

Enter the servername of your storagebox 

![Screenshot of adding remote SMB/NFS share to unRAID, step 2](/images/guides/unraid-storagebox-5.png)

Enter your username

![Screenshot of adding remote SMB/NFS share to unRAID, step 3](/images/guides/unraid-storagebox-6.png)

Enter your password (*scored securely earlier*)

![Screenshot of adding remote SMB/NFS share to unRAID, step 4](/images/guides/unraid-storagebox-7.png)

When prompted for a domain, leave the value blank and just click Next:

Finally, when prompted for a share, enter `backup` (*or the name of your subaccount, if you're using one*), and click `Done`:

!!! warning "A subaccount can only see a share with the same name"
    You won't be able to see the `backup` share with a subaccount. You'll have to use a share with the same name as the subaccount.

Now, you can mount your share, and happily consume the media on your remote storagebox, locally! :thumbsup!

!!! question "What do we have now?"
    You're able to view the media on your storagebox alongside the exitsing media on your unRAID, and transfer files to/from Storagoebox

### Optional extras

Want to share your media with friends and family without exposing your unRAID? Install [Plex][plex], [Jellyfin][jellyfin], or [Emby][emby], and point your libraries at your storagebox, at `/storage/storagebox-a`

## Questions

### Storagebox location

Question:

> What if my storagebox is in Finland, and not Germany?

Answer:

> The torrent-client->storagebox performance will likely be much worse, and Hetzner will ultimately charge me for egress traffic (not currently an issue at our scale), so I'd strongly suggest sticking with Germany

### Integrating local apps

Question: 

> Can my apps (Arrs) running locally on unRAID talk to the torrent clients?

Answer:

> No, because the torrent clients are all protected with a layer of SSO which is applied at the ingress (Traefik) level. While we can **technically** enable/disable SSO per-app (*some apps like Plex are obviously not SSO'd*), the torrent apps will always remain behind SSO due to the risk of an accidental misconfiguration exposing all our customers to suspension / shutdown.

> Any ElfHosted apps can connect with the torrent clients though, so while it's not a **perfect** solution, you may be able to configure [Sonarr][sonarr] / [Radarr][radarr] to import from your home Arr instances.
